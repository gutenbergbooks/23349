<h3>PREFACE</h3>


<p>Lord Gifford in founding his lectureship directed that
the lectures should be public and popular, <i>i.e.</i> not restricted
to members of a University.  Accordingly in lecturing I
endeavoured to make myself intelligible to a general
audience by avoiding much technical discussion and
controversial matter, and by keeping to the plan of
describing in outline the development and decay of the
religion of the Roman City-state. And on the whole I
have thought it better to keep to this principle in publishing
the lectures; they are printed for the most part much
as they were delivered, and without footnotes, but at the
end of each lecture students of the subject will find the
notes referred to by the numbers in the text, containing
such further information or discussion as has seemed
desirable.  My model in this method has been the admirable
lectures of Prof. Cumont on "les Religions
Orientales dans le Paganisme Romain."</p>

<p>I wish to make two remarks about the subject-matter
of the lectures. First, the idea running through them is
that the primitive religious (or magico-religious) instinct,
which was the germ of the religion of the historical
Romans, was gradually atrophied by over-elaboration of
ritual, but showed itself again in strange forms from the
period of the Punic wars onwards. For this religious
instinct I have used the Latin word <i>religio</i>, as I have<span class='pagenum'>viii</span>
explained in the <i>Transactions of the Third International
Congress for the History of Religions</i>, vol. ii. p. 169 foll. I
am, however, well aware that some scholars take a different
view of the original meaning of this famous word, which
has been much discussed since I formed my plan of
lecturing. But I do not think that those who differ from
me on this point will find that my general argument is
seriously affected one way or another by my use of the
word.</p>

<p>Secondly, while I have been at work on the lectures,
the idea seems to have been slowly gaining ground that
the patrician religion of the early City-state, which became
so highly formalised, so clean and austere, and eventually
so political, was really the religion of an invading
race, like that of the Achaeans in Greece, engrafted on
the religion of a primitive and less civilised population.
I have not definitely adopted this idea; but I am inclined
to think that a good deal of what I have said in the
earlier lectures may be found to support it. Once only,
in Lecture XVII., I have used it myself to support a
hypothesis there advanced.</p>

<p>I have retained the familiar English spelling of certain
divine names, <i>e.g.</i> Jupiter (instead of Iuppiter), as less
startling to British readers.</p>

<p>I wish to express my very deep obligations to the
works of Prof. Wissowa and Dr. J. G. Frazer, and also to
Mr. R. R. Marett, who gave me useful personal help in
my second and third lectures. From Prof. Wissowa and
Dr. Frazer I have had the misfortune to differ on one or
two points; but "difference of opinion is the salt of life,"
as a great scholar said to me not long ago. In reading
the proofs I have had much kind and valuable help from
my Oxford friends Mr. Cyril Bailey and Mr. A. S. L.
Farquharson, who have read certain parts of the work, and<span class='pagenum'>ix</span>
to whose suggestions I am greatly indebted. The whole
has been read through by my old pupil Mr. Hugh Parr,
now of Clifton College, to whom my best thanks are due
for his timely discovery of many misprints and awkward
expressions. The loyalty and goodwill of my old Oxford
pupils never seem to fail me.</p>

<td class="cell_left"><p class="two">Accounts of the Roman religion in recent standard works; a hard
and highly formalised system. Its interest lies partly in this
fact. How did it come to be so? This the main question of
the first epoch of Roman religious experience. Roman religion
and Roman law compared. Roman religion a technical subject.
What we mean by religion. A useful definition applied to the
plan of Lectures I.-X.; including (1) survivals of primitive or
quasi-magical religion; (2) the religion of the agricultural family;
(3) that of the City-state, in its simplest form, and in its first
period of expansion. Difficulties of the subject; present position
of knowledge and criticism. Help obtainable from (1) archaeology,
(2) anthropology . . .</p></td>

Totemism not discernible. Taboo, and the means adopted of
escaping from it; both survived at Rome into an age of real
religion. Examples: impurity (or holiness) of new-born infants;
of a corpse; of women in certain worships; of strangers; of
criminals. Almost complete absence of blood-taboo. Iron.
Strange taboos on the priest of Jupiter and his wife. Holy or
tabooed places; holy or tabooed days; the word <i>religiosus</i> as
applied to both of these</p></td>

seek to exclude magic, and did so at Rome. Few survivals of
magic in the State religion. The <i>aquaelicium</i>. Vestals and
runaway slaves. The magical whipping at the Lupercalia. The
throwing of puppets from the <i>pons sublicius</i>. Magical processes
surviving in religious ritual with their meaning lost. Private
magic: <i>excantatio</i> in the XII. Tables; other spells or <i>carmina</i>.

Rome, the city of the four regions; to this belongs the surviving
religious calendar. This calendar described; the basis of our
knowledge of early Roman religion. It expresses a life agricultural,
political, and military. Days of gods distinguished from
days of man. Agricultural life the real basis of the calendar;
gradual effacement of it. Results of a fixed routine in calendar;
discipline, religious confidence. Exclusion from it of the barbarous
and grotesque. Decency and order under an organising
priestly authority

themselves know about them? No personal deity in the religion
of the family. Those of the City-state are <i>numina</i>, marking a
transition from animism to polytheism. Meaning of <i>numen</i>.
Importance of names, which are chiefly adjectival, marking
functional activity. Tellus an exception. Importance of priests
in development of <i>dei</i>. The four great Roman gods and their
priests: Janus, Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus. Characteristics of each
of these in earliest Rome. Juno and the difficulties she presents.

<tr>
<td class="cell_left"><p class="two">No temples in the earliest Rome; meaning of <i>fanum, ara, lucus,
sacellum</i>. No images of gods in these places, until end of regal
period. Thus deities not conceived as persons. Though masculine
and feminine they were not married pairs; Dr. Frazer's
opinion on this point. Examination of his evidence derived
from the <i>libri sacerdotum</i>; meaning of Nerio Martis. Such
combinations of names suggest forms or manifestations of a
deity's activity, not likely to grow into personal deities without
Greek help. Meaning of <i>pater</i> and <i>mater</i> applied to deities;
procreation not indicated by them. The deities of the <i>Indigitamenta</i>;
priestly inventions of a later age. Usener's theory of
Sonderg&ouml;tter criticised so far as it applies to Rome

sacrifice and prayer, fulfilment of vows, lustratio, divination.
Meaning of <i>sacrificium</i>. Little trace of sacramental sacrifice.
Typical sacrifice of <i>ius divinum</i>: both priest and victim must be
acceptable to the deity; means taken to secure this. Ritual of
slaughter: examination and <i>porrectio</i> of entrails. Prayer; the
phrase <i>Macte esto</i> and its importance in explaining Roman sacrifice.
Magical survivals in Roman and Italian prayers; yet they
are essentially religious

moral influence mainly a disciplinary one; and it hypnotised the
religious instinct.</p>
<p class="two">Growth of a new population at end of regal period, also of trade and
industry. New deities from abroad represent these changes:
Hercules of Ara Maxima; Castor and Pollux; Minerva. Diana
of the Aventine reflects a new relation with Latium. Question
as to the real religious influence of these deities. The Capitoline

Etruscan period; increasing social complexity and its effect on
legal matters; result, publication of rules of law, civil and
religious, in XII. Tables, and abolition of legal monopoly of
Pontifices. But they keep control of (1) procedure, (2) interpretation,
till end of fourth century b.c. Publication of Fasti

oneself of the <i>pax deorum</i>; but it was the most futile method
used. Private divination; limited and discouraged by the State,
except in the form of family <i>auspicia</i>. Public divination;
<i>auspicia</i> needed in all State operations; close connection with
<i>imperium</i>. The augurs were skilled advisers of the magistrates,
but could not themselves take the auspices. Probable result of
this: Rome escaped subjection to a hierarchy. Augurs and
<i>auspicia</i> become politically important, but cease to belong to
religion. State divination a clog on political progress. Sinister

Lucretius, and Epicurean idea of the Divine. Arrival of Stoicism
at Rome; Panaetius and the Scipionic circle. Character of
Scipio. The religious side of Stoicism; it teaches a new doctrine
of the relation of man to God. Stoic idea of God as Reason,
and as pervading the universe; adjustment of this to Roman
idea of <i>numina</i>. Stoic idea of Man as possessing Reason, and
so partaking the Divine nature. Influence of these two ideas on
the best type of Roman; they appeal to his idea of Duty, and
ennoble his idea of Law. Weak points in Roman Stoicism: (1)
doctrine of Will, (2) neglect of emotions and sympathy. It

with Platonic Pythagoreanism. Cicero affected by this revival;
his Somnium Scipionis and other later works. His mysticism
takes practical form on the death of his daughter; letters to
Atticus about a <i>fanum</i>. Individualisation of the Manes; freedom
of belief on such questions. Further evidence of Cicero's
tendency to mysticism at this time (45 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), and his belief in a
future life. But did the ordinary Roman so believe? Question
whether he really believed in the torments of Hades. Probability

<h4>LECTURE I</h4>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>


<p>I was invited to prepare these lectures, on Lord Gifford's
foundation, as one who has made a special study of the
religious ideas and practice of the Roman people. So far
as I know, the subject has not been touched upon as yet
by any Gifford lecturer. We are in these days interested
in every form of religion, from the most rudimentary to
the most highly developed; from the ideas of the aborigines
of Australia, which have now become the common
property of anthropologists, to the ethical and spiritual
religions of civilised man. Yet it is remarkable how few
students of the history of religion, apart from one or two
specialists, have been able to find anything instructive in
the religion of the Romans&mdash;of the Romans, I mean, as
distinguished from that vast collection of races and nationalities
which eventually came to be called by the name of
Rome. At the Congress for the History of Religions held
at Oxford in 1908, out of scores of papers read and
offered, not more than one or two even touched on the
early religious ideas of the most practical and powerful
people that the world has ever known.</p>

<p>This is due, in part at least, to the fact that just when
Roman history begins to be of absorbing interest, and
fairly well substantiated by evidence, the Roman religion,
as religion, has already begun to lose its vitality, its purity,
its efficacy. It has become overlaid with foreign rites and
ideas, and it has also become a religious monopoly of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
State; of which the essential characteristic, as Mommsen
has well put it, and as we shall see later on, was "the
conscious retention of the principles of the popular belief,
which were recognised as irrational, for reasons of outward
convenience."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> It was not unlike the religion of the Jews
in the period immediately before the Captivity, and it was
never to profit by the refining and chastening influence of
such lengthy suffering. In this later condition it has not
been attractive to students of religious history; and to
penetrate farther back into the real religious ideas of the
genuine Roman people is a task very far from easy, of
which indeed the difficulties only seem to increase as we
become more familiar with it.</p>

<p>It must be remarked, too, that as a consequence of this
unattractiveness, the accounts given in standard works of
the general features of this religion are rather chilling and
repellent. More than fifty years ago, in the first book of
his <i>Roman History</i>, Mommsen so treated of it&mdash;not indeed
without some reservation,&mdash;and in this matter, as in so
many others, his view remained for many years the
dominant one. He looked at this religion, as was natural
to him, from the point of view of law; in religion as such
he had no particular interest. If I am not mistaken, it
was for him, except in so far as it is connected with
Roman law, the least interesting part of all his far-reaching
Roman studies. More recent writers of credit and ability
have followed his lead, and stress has been laid on the
legal side of religion at Rome; it has been described over
and over again as merely a system of contracts between
gods and worshippers, secured by hard and literal formalism,
and without ethical value or any native principle
of growth. Quite recently, for example, so great an
authority as Professor Cumont has written of it thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Il n'a peut &ecirc;tre jamais exist&eacute; aucune religion aussi
froide, aussi prosa&iuml;que que celle des Romains. Subordonn&eacute;e
&agrave; la politique, elle cherche avant tout, par la
stricte ex&eacute;cution de pratiques appropri&eacute;es, &agrave; assurer &agrave;
l'&Eacute;tat la protection des dieux ou &agrave; d&eacute;tourner les effets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
de leur malveillance. Elle a conclu avec les puissances
c&eacute;lestes un contrat synallagmatique d'o&ugrave; d&eacute;coulent des
obligations r&eacute;ciproques: sacrifices d'une part, faveurs de
l'autre.... Sa liturgie rappelle par la minutie de ses
prescriptions l'ancien droit civil. Cette religion se d&eacute;fie
des abandons de l'&acirc;me et des &eacute;lans de la d&eacute;votion." And
he finishes his description by quoting a few words of the
late M. Jean R&eacute;ville: "The legalism of the Pharisees, in
spite of the dryness of their ritualistic minutiae, could make
the heart vibrate more than the formalism of the Romans."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Now it is not for me to deny the truth of such statements
as this, though I might be disposed to say that it is
rather approximate than complete truth as here expressed,
does not sum up the whole story, and only holds good for a
single epoch of this religious history. But surely, for anyone
interested in the history of religion, a religious system
of such an unusual kind, with characteristics so well
marked, must, one would suppose, be itself an attractive
subject. A religion that becomes highly formalised claims
attention by this very characteristic. At one time, however
far back, it must have accurately expressed the needs and
the aspirations of the Roman people in their struggle for
existence. It is obviously, as described by the writers I
have quoted, a very mature growth, a highly developed
system; and the story, if we could recover it, of the way
in which it came to be thus formalised, should be one of
the deepest interest for students of the history of religion.
Another story, too, that of the gradual discovery of the
<i>inadequacy</i> of this system, and of the engrafting upon it,
or substitution for it, of foreign rites and beliefs, is assuredly
not less instructive; and here, fortunately, our records
make the task of telling it an easier one.</p>

<p>Now these two stories, taken together, sum up what
we may call the <i>religious experience of the Roman people</i>;
and as it is upon these that I wish to concentrate your
attention during this and the following course, I have
called these lectures by that name. My plan is not to
provide an exhaustive account of the details of the Roman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
worship or of the nature of the Roman gods: that can be
found in the works of carefully trained specialists, of whom
I shall have something to say presently. More in accordance
with the intentions of the Founder of these lectures,
I think, will be an attempt to follow out, with such detailed
comment as may be necessary, the religious experience
of the Romans, as an important part of their history.
And this happens to coincide with my own inclination
and training; for I have been all my academic life occupied
in learning and teaching Roman history, and the
fascination which the study of the Roman religion has
long had for me is simply due to this fact. Whatever
may be the case with other religions, it is impossible to
think of that of the Romans as detached from their history
as a whole; it is an integral part of the life and growth of
the people. An adequate knowledge of Roman history,
with all its difficulties and doubts, is the only scientific
basis for the study of Roman religion, just as an adequate
knowledge of Jewish history is the only scientific basis for
a study of Jewish religion. The same rule must hold good
in a greater or less degree with all other forms of religion
of the higher type, and even when we are dealing with the
religious ideas of savage peoples it is well to bear it steadfastly
in mind. I may be excused for suggesting that in
works on comparative religion and morals this principle is
not always sufficiently realised, and that the panorama of
religious or quasi-religious practice from all parts of the
world, and found among peoples of very different stages
of development, with which we are now so familiar, needs
constant testing by increased knowledge of those peoples
in all their relations of life. At any rate, in dealing with
Roman evidence the investigator of religious history should
also be a student of Roman history generally, for the facts
of Roman life, public and private, are all closely concatenated
together, and spring with an organic growth from
the same root. The branches tend to separate, but the
tree is of regular growth, compact in all its parts, and you
cannot safely concentrate your attention on one of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
parts to the comparative neglect of the rest. Conversely,
too, the great story of the rise and decay of the Roman
dominion cannot be properly understood without following
out the religious history of this people&mdash;their religious
experience, as I prefer to call it. To take an example of
this, let me remind you of two leading facts in Roman
history: first, the strength and tenacity of the family as a
group under the absolute government of the paterfamilias;
secondly, the strength and tenacity of the idea of the State
as represented by the <i>imperium</i> of its magistrates. How
different in these respects are the Romans from the Celts,
the Scandinavians, even from the Greeks! But these two
facts are in great measure the result of the religious ideas
of the people, and, on the other hand, they themselves react
with astonishing force on the fortunes of that religion.</p>

<p>I do not indeed wish to be understood as maintaining
that the religion of the Roman was the most important
element in his mental or civic development: far from it.
I should be the first to concede that the religious element
in the Roman mind was not that part of it which has left
the deepest impress on history, or contributed much, except
in externals, to our modern ideas of the Divine and of
worship. It is not, as Roman law was, the one great contribution
of the Roman genius to the evolution of humanity.
But Roman law and Roman religion sprang from the same
root; they were indeed in origin <i>one and the same thing</i>.
Religious law was a part of the <i>ius civile</i>, and both were
originally administered by the same authority, the Rex.
Following the course of the two side by side for a few
centuries, we come upon an astonishing phenomenon,
which I will mention now (it will meet us again) as
showing how far more interest can be aroused in our
subject if we are fully equipped as Roman historians than
if we were to study the religion alone, torn from the living
body of the State, and placed on the dissecting-board by
itself. As the State grew in population and importance,
and came into contact, friendly or hostile, with other
peoples, both the religion and the law of the State were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
called upon to expand, and they did so. But they did so
in different ways; Roman law expanded <i>organically</i> and
intensively, absorbing into its own body the experience
and practice of other peoples, while Roman religion expanded
<i>mechanically</i> and extensively, by taking on the
deities and worship of others <i>without any organic change
of its own being</i>. Just as the English language has been
able to absorb words of Latin origin, through its early
contact with French, into the very tissue and fibre of its
being, while German has for certain reasons never been
able to do this, but has adopted them as strangers only,
without making them its very own: so Roman law contrived
to take into its own being the rules and practices of
strangers, while Roman religion, though it eventually admitted
the ideas and cults of Greeks and others, did so
without taking them by a digestive process into its own
system. Had the law of Rome remained as inelastic as
the religion, the Roman people would have advanced as
little in civilisation as those races which embraced the faith
of Islam, with its law and religion alike impermeable to
any change.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Here is a phenomenon that at once attracts
attention and suggests questions not easy to answer.
Why is it that the Roman religion can never have the
same interest and value for mankind as Roman law? I
hope that we shall find an answer to this question in the
course of our studies: at this moment I only propose it
as an example of the advantage gained for the study of
one department of Roman life and thought by a pretty
complete equipment in the knowledge of others.</p>

<p>At the same time we must remember that the religion
of the Romans is a highly technical subject, like Roman
law, the Roman constitution, and almost everything else
Roman; it calls for special knowledge as well as a sufficient
training in Roman institutions generally. Each of
these Roman subjects is like a language with a delicate
accidence, which is always presenting the unwary with
pitfalls into which they are sure to blunder unless they
have a thorough mastery of it. I could mention a book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
full of valuable thoughts about the relation to Paganism
of the early Christian Church, by a scholar at once
learned and sympathetic;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> who when he happens to deal
for a moment with the old Roman religion, is inaccurate
and misleading at every point. He knew, for
example, that this religion is built on the foundation of
the worship of the family, but he yielded to the temptation
to assume that the family in heaven was a counterpart
of the family on earth, "as it might be seen in any
palace of the Roman nobility." "Jupiter and Juno," he
says, "were the lord and lady, and beneath them was
an army of officers, attendants, ministers, of every rank
and degree." Such a description of the pantheon of his
religion would have utterly puzzled a Roman, even in
the later days of theological syncretism. Again he says
that this religion was strongly moral; that "the gods
gave every man his duty, and expected him to perform
it." Here again no Roman of historical times, or indeed
of any age, could have allowed this to be his creed.
Had it really been so, not only the history of the Roman
religion, but that of the Roman state, would have been
very different from what it actually was.</p>

<p>The principles then on which I wish to proceed in
these lectures are&mdash;(1) to keep the subject in continual
touch with Roman history and the development of the
Roman state; (2) to exercise all possible care and
accuracy in dealing with the technical matters of the
religion itself. I may now go on to explain more
exactly the plan I propose to follow.</p>

<p>It will greatly assist me in this explanation if I begin
by making clear what I understand, for our present purposes,
by the word <i>religion</i>. There have been many
definitions propounded&mdash;more in recent years than ever
before, owing to the recognition of the study of religion
as a department of anthropology. Controversies are
going on which call for new definitions, and it is only
by slow degrees that we are arriving at any common
understanding as to the real essential thing or fact for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
which we should reserve this famous word, and other
words closely connected with it, <i>e.g.</i> the supernatural.
We are still disputing, for example, as to the relation of
religion to magic, and therefore as to the exact meaning
to be attributed to each of these terms.</p>

<p>Among the many definitions of religion which I have
met with, there is one which seems to me to be particularly
helpful for our present purposes; it is contributed
by an American investigator. "<i>Religion is the
effective desire to be in right relation to the Power manifesting
itself in the universe.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Dr. Frazer's definition is
not different in essentials: "By religion I understand a
propitiation or conciliation of powers superior to man
which are believed to direct and control the course of
nature and of human life;"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> only that here the word is
used of acts of worship rather than of the feeling or
desire that prompts them. The definition of the late
M. Jean R&eacute;ville, in a chapter on "Religious Experience,"
written near the end of his valuable life, is in my view
nearer the mark, and more comprehensive. "Religion,"
he says, "is essentially a principle of life, the feeling of
a living relation between the human individual and the
powers or power of which the universe is the manifestation.
What characterises each religion is its way of
looking upon this relation and its method of applying
it."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> And a little further on he writes: "It is generally
admitted that this feeling of dependence upon the universe
is the root of all religion." But this is not so
succinct as the definition which I quoted first, and it
introduces at least one term, <i>the individual</i>, which, for
certain good reasons, I think it will be better for us to
avoid in studying the early Roman religious ideas.</p>

<p>"<i>Religion is the effective desire to be in right relations
with the Power manifesting itself in the universe.</i>" This
has the advantage of treating religion as primarily and
essentially a <i>feeling</i>, an instinctive desire, and the word
"effective," skilfully introduced, suggests that this feeling
manifests itself in certain actions undertaken in order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
secure a desired end. Again, the phrase "right relations"
seems to me well chosen, and better than the "living
relation" of M. R&eacute;ville, which if applied to the religions
of antiquity can only be understood in a sacramental
sense, and is not obviously so intended. "Right relation"
will cover all religious feeling, from the most material to
the most spiritual. Think for a moment of the 119th
Psalm, the high-water mark of the religious feeling of
the most religious people of antiquity; it is a magnificent
declaration of conformity to the will of God, <i>i.e.</i> of the
desire to be in right relation to Him, to His statutes,
judgments, laws, commands, testimonies, righteousness.
This is religion in a high state of development; but our
definition is so skilfully worded as to adapt itself readily
to much earlier and simpler forms. The "Power manifesting
itself in the universe" may be taken as including
all the workings of nature, which even now we most
imperfectly understand, and which primitive man so little
understood that he misinterpreted them in a hundred
different ways. The effective desire to be in right relation
with these mysterious powers, so that they might
not interfere with his material well-being&mdash;with his flocks
and herds, with his crops, too, if he were in the agricultural
stage, with his dwelling and his land, or with
his city if he had got so far in social development&mdash;this
is what we may call the religious instinct, the origin of
what the Romans called <i>religio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> The effective desire
to have your own will brought into conformity to the
will of a heavenly Father is a later development of the
same feeling; to this the genuine Roman never attained,
and the Greek very imperfectly.</p>

<p>If we keep this definition steadily in mind, I think we
shall find it a valuable guide in following out what I call
the religious experience of the Roman people; and at
the present moment it will help me to explain my plan
in drawing up these lectures. To begin with, in the
prehistoric age of Rome, so far as we can discern from
survivals of a later age, the feeling or desire must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
taken shape, ineffectively indeed, in many quaint acts,
some of them magical or quasi-magical, and possibly
taken over from an earlier and ruder population among
whom the Latins settled. Many of these continued,
doubtless, to exist among the common folk, unauthorised
by any constituted power, while some few were absorbed
into the religious practice of the State, probably with the
speedy loss of their original significance. Such survivals
of ineffective religion are of course to be found in the
lowest stratum of the religious ideas of every people,
ancient and modern; even among the Israelites,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> and in
the rites of Islam or Christianity. They form, as it were,
<i>a kind of protoplasm of religious vitality</i>, from which an
organic growth was gradually developed. But though
they are necessarily a matter of investigation as survivals
which have a story to tell, they do not carry us very far
when we are tracing the religious experience of a people,
and in any case the process of investigating them is one
of groping in the dark. I shall deal with these survivals
in my next two lectures, and then leave them for good.</p>

<p>I am more immediately concerned with the desire
expressed in our definition <i>when it has become more
effective</i>; and this we find in the Latins when they have
attained to a complete settlement on the land, and are
well on in the agricultural stage of social development.
This stage we can dimly see reflected in the life of the
home and farm of later times; we have, I need hardly
say, no contemporary evidence of it, though archaeology
may yet yield us something. But the conservatism of
rural life is a familiar fact, and comes home to me when
I reflect that in my own English village the main features
of work and worship remained the same through many
centuries, until we were revolutionised by the enclosure
of the parish and the coming of the railroad in the
middle of the nineteenth century. The intense conservatism
of rural Italy, up to the present day, has
always been an acknowledged fact, and admits of easy
explanation. We may be sure that the Latin farmer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
before the City-state was developed, was like his descendants
of historical times, the religious head of a family,
whose household deities were <i>effectively</i> worshipped by a
regular and orderly procedure, whose dead were cared
for in like manner, and whose land and stock were protected
from malignant spirits by a boundary made sacred
by yearly rites of sacrifice and prayer. Doubtless these
wild spirits beyond his boundaries were a constant source
of anxiety to him; doubtless charms and spells and
other survivals from the earlier stage were in use to keep
them from mischief; but these tend to become exceptions
in an orderly life of agricultural routine which we may
call <i>religious</i>. Spirits may accept domicile within the
limits of the farm, and tend, as always in this agricultural
stage, to become fixed to the soil and to take more
definite shape as in some sense deities. This stage&mdash;that
of the agricultural family&mdash;is the foundation of
Roman civilised life, in religious as in all other aspects,
and it will form the subject of my fourth lecture.</p>

<p>The growing effectiveness of the desire, as seen in
the family and in the agricultural stage, prepares us for
still greater effectiveness in the higher form of civilisation
which we know as that of the City-state. That desire,
let me say once more, is to be in right relations with the
Power manifesting itself in the universe. It is only in
the higher stages of civilisation that this desire can really
become effective; social organisation, as I shall show,
produces an increased knowledge of the nature of the
Power, and with it a systematisation of the means
deemed necessary to secure the right relations. The
City-state, the peculiar form in which Greek and Italian
social and political life eventually blossomed and fructified,
was admirably fitted to secure this effectiveness. It was,
of course, an intensely <i>local</i> system; and the result was,
first, that the Power is localised in certain spots and propitiated
by certain forms of cult within the city wall,
thus bringing the divine into closest touch with the
human population and its interests; and secondly, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
the concentration of intelligence and will-power within a
small space might, and did at Rome, develop a very
elaborate system for securing the right relations&mdash;in other
words, it produced a religious system as highly ritualistic
as that of the Jews.</p>

<p>With the several aspects of this system my fifth and
succeeding lectures will be occupied. I shall deal first
with the religious calendar of the earliest historical form
of the City-state, which most fortunately has come down
to us entire. I shall devote two lectures to the early
Roman ideas of divinity, and the character of their deities
as reflected in the calendar, and as further explained
by Roman and Greek writers of the literary age. Two
other lectures will discuss the ritual of sacrifice and
prayer, with the priests in charge of these ceremonies, and
the ritual of vows and of "purification." In each of these
I shall try to point out wherein the weakness of this
religious system lay&mdash;viz. in attempts at effectiveness so
elaborate that they overshot their mark, in a misconception
of the means necessary to secure the right relations, and
in a failure to grow in knowledge of the Power itself.</p>

<p>Lastly, as the City-state advances socially and politically,
in trade and commerce, in alliance and conquest,
we shall find that the ideas of other peoples about the
Power, and their methods of propitiation, begin to be
adopted in addition to the native stock. The first stages
of this revolution will bring us to the conclusion of my
present course; but we shall be then well prepared for
what follows. For later on we shall find the Romans
feeling afresh the desire to be in right relation with the
Power, discovering that their own highly formalised system
is no longer equal to the work demanded of it, and pitiably
mistaking their true course in seeking a remedy. Their
knowledge of the Divine, always narrow and limited,
becomes by degrees blurred and obscured, and their sight
begins to fail them. I hope in due course to explain
this, and to give you some idea of the sadness of their
religious experience before the advent of an age of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
philosophy, of theological syncretism, and of the worship
of the rulers of the state.</p>

<p>Let us now turn for a few minutes to the special
difficulties of our subject. These are serious enough; but
they have been wonderfully and happily reduced since I
began to be interested in the Roman religion some twenty-five
years ago. There were then only two really valuable
books which dealt with the whole subject. Though I
could avail myself of many treatises, good and bad, on
particular aspects of it, some few of which still survive,
the only two comprehensive and illuminating books were
Preller's <i>R&ouml;mische Mythologie</i>, and Marquardt's volume on
the cult in his <i>Staatsverwaltung</i>. Both of these were
then already many years old, but they had just been reedited
by two eminent scholars thoroughly well equipped
for the task&mdash;Preller's work by H. Jordan, and Marquardt's
by Georg Wissowa. They were written from
different points of view; Preller dealt with the deities and
the ideas about them rather than with the cults and the
priests concerned with them; while Marquardt treated the
subject as a part of the administration of government, dealing
with the worship and the <i>ius divinum</i>, and claiming
that this was the only safe and true way of arriving at the
ideas underlying that law and worship.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Both books are
still indispensable for the student; but Marquardt's is the
safer guide, as dealing with facts to the exclusion of
fancies. The two taken together had collected and sifted
the evidence so far as it was then available.</p>

<p>The <i>Corpus Inscriptionum</i> had not at that time got
very far, but its first volume, edited by Mommsen, contained
the ancient Fasti, which supply us with the religious
calendar of early Rome, and with other matter throwing
light upon it. This first volume was an invaluable help,
and formed the basis (in a second edition) of the book I
was eventually able to write on the <i>Roman Festivals of the
Period of the Republic</i>. At that time, too, in the 'eighties,
Roscher's <i>Lexicon of Greek and Roman Mythology</i> began
to appear, which aimed at summing up all that was then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
known about the deities of both peoples; this is not even
yet completed, and many of the earlier articles seem now
almost antiquated, as propounding theories which have not
met with general acceptance. All these earlier articles
are now being superseded by those in the new edition
of Pauly's <i>Real-Encyclop&auml;die</i>, edited by Wissowa. Lastly,
Wissowa himself in 1902 published a large volume
entitled <i>Die Religion und Kultus der R&ouml;mer</i>, which will
probably be for many years the best and safest guide for
all students of our subject. Thoroughly trained in the
methods of dealing with evidence both literary and
archaeological, Wissowa produced a work which, though it
has certain limitations, has the great merit of not being
likely to lead anyone astray. More skilfully and successfully
than any of his predecessors, he avoided the chief
danger and difficulty that beset all who meddle with
Roman religious antiquities, and invariably lead the
unwary to their destruction; he declined to accept as
evidence what in nine cases out of ten is no true evidence
at all&mdash;the statements of ancient authors influenced by
Greek ideas and Greek fancy. He holds in the main to
the principle laid down by Marquardt, that we may use,
as evidence for their religious ideas, what we are told that
the Romans <i>did</i> in practising their worship, but must regard
with suspicion, and subject to severe criticism, what either
they themselves or the Greeks wrote about those religious
ideas&mdash;that is, about divine beings and their doings.</p>

<p>It is indeed true that the one great difficulty of our
subject lies in the nature of the evidence; and it is one
which we can never hope entirely to overcome. We have
always to bear in mind that the Romans produced no
literature till the third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>; and the documentary
evidence that survives from an earlier age in the form of
inscriptions, or fragments of hymns or of ancient law
(such as the calendar of which I spoke just now), is of
the most meagre character, and usually most difficult to
interpret. Thus the Roman religion stands alone among
the religions of ancient civilisations in that we are almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
entirely without surviving texts of its forms of prayer, of
its hymns or its legends;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> even in Greece the Homeric
poems, with all the earliest Greek literature and art, make up
to some extent for the want of that documentary evidence
which throws a flood of light on the religions of Babylon,
Egypt, the Hindus, and the Jewish people. We know in
fact as little about the religion of the old Italian populations
as we do about that of our own Teutonic ancestors,
less perhaps than we do about that of the Celtic peoples.
The Romans were a rude and warlike folk, and meddled
neither with literature nor philosophy until they came
into immediate contact with the Greeks; thus it was that,
unfortunately for our purposes, the literary spirit, when at
last it was born in Italy, was rather Greek than Roman.
When that birth took place Rome had spread her influence
over Italy,&mdash;perhaps the greatest work she ever accomplished;
and thus the latest historian of Latin literature
can venture to write that "the greatest time in Roman
history was already past when real historical evidence
becomes available."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>We have thus to face two formidable facts: (1)
that the period covered by my earlier lectures must
in honesty be called prehistoric; and (2) that when
the Romans themselves began to write about it they did
so under the overwhelming influence of Greek culture.
With few exceptions, all that we can learn of the early
Roman religion from Roman or Greek writers comes
to us, not in a pure Roman form, clearly conceived as
all things truly Roman were, but seen dimly through
the mist of the Hellenistic age. The Roman gods, for
example, are made the sport of fancy and the subject
of Hellenistic love-stories, by Greek poets and their
Roman imitators,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> or are more seriously treated by Graeco-Roman
philosophy after a fashion which would have been
absolutely incomprehensible to the primitive men in whose
minds they first had their being. The process of disentangling
the Roman element from the Greek in the
literary evidence is one which can never be satisfactorily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
accomplished; and on the whole it is better, with Wissowa
and Marquardt, to hold fast by the facts of the cult,
where the distinction between the two is usually obvious,
than to flounder about in a slough of what I can only
call pseudo-evidence. If all that English people knew
about their Anglo-Saxon forefathers were derived from
Norman-French chroniclers, how much should we really
know about government or religion in the centuries before
the Conquest! And yet this comparison gives but a
faint idea of the treacherous nature of the literary evidence
I am speaking of. It is true indeed that in the last age
of the Republic a few Romans began to take something
like a scientific interest in their own religious antiquities;
and to Varro, by far the most learned of these, and to
Verrius Flaccus, who succeeded him in the Augustan
age, we owe directly or indirectly almost all the solid
facts on which our knowledge of the Roman worship
rests. But their works have come down to us in a most
imperfect and fragmentary state, and what we have of them
we owe mainly to the erudition of later grammarians and
commentators, and the learning of the early Christian
fathers, who drew upon them freely for illustrations of the
absurdities of paganism. And it must be added that
when Varro himself deals with the Roman gods and the
old ideas about them, he is by no means free from the
inevitable influence of Greek thought.</p>

<p>Apart from the literary material and the few surviving
fragments of religious law and ritual, there are two other
sources of light of which we can now avail ourselves,
archaeology and anthropology; but it must be confessed
that as yet their illuminating power is somewhat uncertain.
It reminds the scrupulous investigator of those early days
of the electric light, when its flickering tremulousness
made it often painful to read by, and when, too, it might
suddenly go out and leave the reader in darkness. It is
well to remember that both sciences are young, and have
much of the self-confidence of youth; and that Italian
archaeology, now fast becoming well organised within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Italy, has also to be co-ordinated with the archaeology
of the whole Mediterranean basin, before we can expect
from it clear and unmistakable answers to hard questions
about race and religion. This work, which cannot possibly
be done by an individual without <i>co-operation</i>&mdash;the secret
of sound work which the Germans have long ago discovered&mdash;is
in course of being carried out, so far as is at present
possible, by a syndicate of competent investigators.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>In order to indicate the uncertain nature of the light
which for a long time to come is all we can expect from
Italian archaeology, I have only to remind you that one
of the chief questions we have to ask of it is the relation
of the mysterious Etruscan people to the other Italian
stocks, in respect of language, religion, and art. Whether
the Etruscans were the same people whom the Greeks
called Pelasgians, as many investigators now hold: whether
the earliest Roman city was in any true sense an Etruscan
one: these are questions on the answers to which it is not
as yet safe to build further hypotheses. In regard to
religion, too, we are still very much in the dark. For
example, there are many Etruscan works of art in which
Roman deities are portrayed, as is certain from the fact
that their names accompany the figures; but it is as yet
almost impossible to determine how far we can use these
for the interpretation of Roman religious ideas or legends.
Many years ago a most attractive hypothesis was raised
on the evidence of certain of these works of art, where
Hercules and Juno appear together in a manner which
strongly suggests that they are meant to represent the
male and female principles of human life; this hypothesis
was taken up by early writers in the <i>Mythological Lexicon</i>,
and relying upon them I adopted it in my <i>Roman Festivals</i>,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
and further applied it to the interpretation of an unsolved
problem in the fourth <i>Eclogue</i> of Virgil.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> But since
then doubt has been thrown on it by Wissowa, who had
formerly accepted it. As being of Etruscan origin, and
found in places very distant from each other and from
Rome, we have, he says, no good right to use these works<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
of art as evidence for the Roman religion.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> The question
remains open as to these and many other works of art,
but the fact that the man of coolest judgment and most
absolute honesty is doubtful, suggests that we had best
wait patiently for more certain light.</p>

<p>In Rome itself, where archaeological study is concentrated
and admirably staffed, great progress has been
made, and much light thrown on the later periods of
religious history. But for the religion of the ancient
Roman state, with which we are at present concerned, it
must be confessed that very little has been gleaned.
The most famous discovery is that recently made in the
Forum of an archaic inscription which almost certainly
relates to some religious act; but as yet no scholar has
been able to interpret it with anything approaching to
certainty.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> More recently excavations on the further
bank of the Tiber threw a glint of light on the nature
of an ancient deity, Furrina, about whom till then we
practically knew nothing at all; but the evidence thus
obtained was late and in Greek characters. We must
in fact entertain no great hopes of illumination from
excavations, but accept thankfully what little may be
vouchsafed to us. On the other hand, from the gradual
development of Italian archaeology as a whole, and, I
must here add, from the study of the several old Italian
languages, much may be expected in the future.</p>

<p>The other chief contributory science is anthropology,
<i>i.e.</i> the study of the working of the mind of primitive
man, as it is seen in the ideas and practices of uncivilised
peoples at the present day, and also as it can be traced in
survivals among more civilised races. For the history of
the religion of the Roman City-state its contribution
must of necessity be a limited one; that is a part of
Roman history in general, and its material is purely
Roman, or perhaps I should say, Graeco-Roman; and
Wissowa in all his work has consistently declined to
admit the value of anthropological researches for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>elucidation of Roman problems. Perhaps it is for this
very reason that his book is the safest guide we
possess for the study of what the Romans did and
thought in the matter of religion; but if we wish to
try and get to the original significance of those acts
and thoughts, it is absolutely impossible in these days
to dispense with the works of a long series of anthropologists,
many of them fortunately British, who have
gradually been collecting and classifying the material
which in the long run will fructify in definite results.
If we consider the writings of eminent scholars who
wrote about Greek and Roman religion and mythology
before the appearance of Dr. Tylor's <i>Primitive Culture</i>&mdash;Klausen,
Preuner, Preller, Kuhn, and many others,
who worked on the comparative method but with
slender material for the use of it&mdash;we see at once what
an immense advance has been effected by that monumental
work, and by the stimulus that it gave to others
to follow the same track. Now we have in this country
the works of Lang, Robertson Smith, Farnell, Frazer,
Hartland, Jevons, and others, while a host of students on
the Continent are writing in all languages on anthropological
subjects. Some of these I shall quote incidentally
in the course of these lectures; at present I will
content myself with making one or two suggestions as to
the care needed in using the collections and theories of
anthropologists, as an aid in Roman religious studies.</p>

<p>First, let us bear in mind that anthropologists are apt
to have their favourite theories&mdash;conclusions, that is, which
are the legitimate result of reasoning inductively on the
class of facts which they have more particularly studied.
Thus Mannhardt had his theory of the Vegetation-spirit,
Robertson Smith that of the sacramental meal, Usener
that of the Sonderg&ouml;tter, Dr. Frazer that of divine
Kingship; all of which are perfectly sound conclusions
based on facts which no one disputes. They have been
of the greatest value to anthropological research; but
when they are applied to the explanation of Roman
practices we should be instantly on our guard, ready<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
indeed to welcome any glint of light that we may get
from them, but most carefully critical and even suspicious
of their application to other phenomena than those which
originally suggested them. It is in the nature of man
as a researcher, when he has found a key, to hasten to
apply it to all the doors he can find, and sometimes, it
must be said, to use violence in the application; and
though the greatest masters of the science will rarely try
to force the lock, they will use so much gentle persuasion
as sometimes to make us fancy that they have unfastened
it. All such attempts have their value, but it behoves
us to be cautious in accepting them. The application by
Mannhardt of the theory of the Vegetation-spirit to
certain Roman problems, <i>e.g.</i> to that of the Lupercalia,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
and the October horse,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> must be allowed, fascinating
as it was, to have failed in the main. The application
by Dr. Frazer of the theory of divine Kingship to the
early religious history of Rome, is still <i>sub judice</i>, and
calls for most careful and discriminating criticism.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>Secondly, as I have already said, Roman evidence is
peculiarly difficult to handle, except in so far as it deals
with the simple facts of worship; when we use it for
traditions, myths, ideas about the nature of divine beings,
we need a training not only in the use of evidence in
general, but in the use of Roman evidence in particular.
Anthropologists, as a rule, have not been through such
a training, and they are apt to handle the evidence of
Roman writers with a light heart and rather a rough
hand. The result is that bits of evidence are put
together, each needing conscientious criticism, to support
hypotheses often of the flimsiest kind, which again are
used to support further hypotheses, and so on, until the
sober inquirer begins to feel his brain reeling and his
footing giving way beneath him. I shall have occasion
to notice one or two examples of this uncritical use of
evidence later on, and will say no more of it now. No
one can feel more grateful than I do to the many leading
anthropologists who have touched in one way or another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
on Roman evidence; but for myself I try never to forget
the words of Columella, with which a great German
scholar began one of his most difficult investigations:
"In universa vita pretiosissimum est intellegere quemque
nescire se quod nesciat."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

of Theology in the Greek Philosophers"), vol. i. p. 32. "That
which underlies all forms of religion, from the highest to the lowest,
is the idea of God as an absolute power or principle." To this
need only be added the desire to be in right relation to it. Mr.
Marett's word "supernaturalism" seems to mean the same thing;
"There arises in the region of human thought a powerful impulse
to objectify, and even to personify, the mysterious or supernatural
something felt; and in the region of will a corresponding impulse
to render it innocuous, or, better still, propitious, by force of
constraint (<i>i.e.</i> magic), communion, or conciliation." See his
<i>Threshold of Religion</i>, p. 11. Prof. Haddon, commenting on this
(<i>Magic and Fetishism</i>, p. 93), adds that "there are thus produced
the two fundamental factors of religion, the belief in some mysterious
power, and the desire to enter into communication with the power
by means of worship." Our succinct definition seems thus to be
adequate.</p></div>

some extent by preserving for us features of the worship as it existed
in their own day. The confusion that has been caused in Roman
religious history by mixing up Greek and Roman evidence is incalculable,
and has recently been increased by Pais (<i>Storia di Roma</i>,
and <i>Ancient Legends of Roman History</i>), and by Dr. Frazer in his
lectures on the early history of Kingship&mdash;writers to whom in some

well illustrates the difficulties under which we have to work while
archaeologists, ethnologists, and philologists are still constantly in
disagreement as to almost every important question in the history
of early Italian culture. Dr. Binder's main thesis is that the
earliest Rome was composed of two distinct communities, each
with its own religion, <i>i.e.</i> deities, priests, and sacra; the one
settled on the Palatine, a pastoral folk of primitive culture, and of
pure Latin race; the other settled on the Quirinal, Sabine in origin
and language, and of more advanced development in social and
religious matters. So far this sounds more or less familiar to us,
but when Dr. Binder goes on to identify the Latin folk with the
Plebs and the Sabine settlement with the Patricians, and calls in
religion to help him with the proof of this, it is necessary to look
very carefully into the religious evidence he adduces. So far as I
can see, the limitation of the word <i>patrician</i> to the Quirinal settlement
is very far from being proved by this evidence (see <i>The
Year's Work in Classical Studies</i>, 1909, p. 69). Yet the hypothesis
is an extremely interesting one, and were it generally accepted,
would compel us to modify in some important points our ideas of
Roman religious history, and also of Roman legal history, with
which Dr. Binder is mainly concerned.</p></div>

<h4>LECTURE II</h4>

<h5>ON THE THRESHOLD OF RELIGION: SURVIVALS</h5>


<p>My subject proper is the religion of an organised State:
the religious experience of a comparatively civilised
people. But I wish, in the first place, to do what has
never yet been done by those who have written on
the Roman religion&mdash;I wish to take a survey of the
relics, surviving in later Roman practice and belief, of
earlier stages of rudimentary religious experience. In
these days of anthropological and sociological research,
it is possible to do this without great difficulty; and if I
left it undone, our story of the development of religion
at Rome would be mutilated at the beginning. Also
we should be at a disadvantage in trying to realise the
wonderful work done by the early authorities of the
State in eliminating from their rule of worship (<i>ius
divinum</i>) almost all that was magical, barbarous, or, as
later Romans would have called it, superstitious. This
is a point on which I wish to lay especial stress in the
next few lectures, and it entails a somewhat tiresome
account of the ideas and practices of which, as I believe,
they sought to get rid. These, I may as well say at
once, are to be found for the most part surviving, as we
might expect, <i>outside</i> of the religion of the State; where
they survive within its limits, they will be found to have
almost entirely lost their original force and meaning.</p>

<p>Every student of religious history knows that a
religious system is a complex growth, far more complex
than would appear at first sight; that it is sure to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
contain relics of previous eras of human experience,
embedded in the social strata as lifeless fossils. These
only indeed survive because human nature is intensely
conservative, especially in religious matters; and of this
conservative instinct the Romans afford as striking an
example as we can readily find. They clung with extraordinary
tenacity, all through their history, to old forms;
they seem to have had a kind of superstitious feeling that
these dead forms had still a value as such, though all
the life was gone out of them. It would be easy to
illustrate this curious feature of the Roman mind from
the history of its religion; it never disappeared; and to
this day the Catholic church in Italy retains in a thinly-disguised
form many of the religious practices of the
Roman people.</p>

<p>Stage after stage must have been passed by the
Latins long before our story rightly begins; how many
revolutions of thought they underwent, how much they
learnt and took over from earlier inhabitants of the country
in which they finally settled, we cannot even guess. As I
said in the last lecture, we have no really ancient history
of the Romans, as we have, for example, of the Egyptians
or Babylonians; to us it is all darkness, save where a
little light has been thrown on the buried strata by
archaeology and anthropology. That little light, which
may be expected to increase in power, shows survivals
here and there of primitive modes of thought; and
these I propose to deal with now in the following order.
<i>Totemism</i> I shall mention merely to clear it out of the
way; but <i>taboo</i> will take us some little time, and so will
<i>magic</i> in its various forms.</p>

<p>About totemism all I have to say is this. As I
write, Dr. Frazer's great work on this subject has just
appeared; it is entirely occupied with totemism among
modern savages, true totemic peoples, with the object
of getting at the real principles of that curious stratum
of human thought, and he leaves to others the discussion
of possible survivals of it among Aryans, Semites, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Egyptians. He himself is sceptical about all the evidence
that has been adduced to prove its existence in classical
antiquity (see vol. i. p. 86 and vol. iv. p. 13). Under these
circumstances, and seeing that Dr. Frazer has always been
the accepted exponent of totemism in this country since
the epoch-making works appeared of Tylor and Robertson
Smith, it is obviously unnecessary for me either to
attempt to explain what it is, or to examine the attempts
to find survivals of it in ancient Italy. When it first
became matter of interest to anthropologists it was only
natural that they should be apt to find it everywhere. Dr.
Jevons, for example, following in the steps of Robertson
Smith, found plenty of totemistic survivals both in Greece
and Italy in writing his valuable <i>Introduction to the History
of Religion</i>; but he is now aware that he went too far in
this direction. Quite recently there has been a run after
the same scent in France; not long ago a French scholar
published a book on the ensigns of the Roman army,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
which originally represented certain animals, and using
Dr. Frazer's early work on totemism with a very imperfect
knowledge of the subject, tried to prove that
these were originally totem signs. Roman names of
families and old Italian tribe-names are still often quoted
as totemistic; but the Fabii and Caepiones, named after
cultivated plants, and the Picentes and Hirpini, after
woodpecker and wolf, though tempting to the totemist,
have not persuaded Dr. Frazer to accept them as
totemistic, and may be left out of account here; there
may be many reasons for the adoption of such names
besides the totemistic one. In the course of the last
Congress of religious history, a sober French scholar,
M. Toutain, made an emphatic protest against the
prevailing tendency in France, of which the leading
representative is M. Salomon Reinach.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Let us pass
on at once to the second primitive mode of thought which
I mentioned just now, and which is not nearly so remote&mdash;speaking
anthropologically&mdash;from classical times as
totemism. Totemism belongs to a form of society, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
of tribe or clan, in which family life is unknown in our
sense of the word, and it is therefore wholly remote
from the life of the ancient Italian stocks, in whose social
organisation the family was a leading fact; but <i>taboo</i>
seems rather to be a mode of thought common to primitive
peoples up to a comparatively advanced stage of development,
and has left its traces in all systems of religion,
including those of the present day.</p>

<p>By this famous word <i>taboo</i>, of Polynesian origin,
is to be understood a very important part of what I
have called the protoplasm of primitive religion, and one
closely allied both to magic and fetishism. For our
present purposes we may define it as a mysterious
influence believed to exist in objects both animate and
inanimate, which makes them <i>dangerous</i>, <i>infectious</i>, <i>unclean</i>,
<i>or holy</i>, which two last qualities are often almost
identical in primitive thought, as Robertson Smith
originally taught us.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> What exactly the savage or semi-civilised
mind thought about this influence we hardly
yet know; we have another Polynesian word, <i>mana</i>,
which expresses conveniently its positive aspect, and may
in time help us towards a better understanding of it.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> It
is in origin pre-animistic, <i>i.e.</i> it is not so much believed
to emanate from a <i>spirit</i> residing in the object, as from
some occult miasmatic quality. All human beings in
contact with other men or things possessing this quality
are believed to suffer in some way, and to communicate
the infection which they themselves receive. As Dr.
Farnell says in his chapter on the ritual of purification,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>
"The sense-instinct that suggests all this was
probably some primeval terror or aversion evoked by
certain objects, as we see animals shrink with disgust
at the sight or smell of blood. The nerves of savage
man are strangely excited by certain stimuli of touch,
smell, taste, sight; the specially exciting object is something
that we should call mysterious, weird, or uncanny."</p>

<p>Based on this notion of constant danger from infection,
there arose a code of unwritten custom as rigid as that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
enforced by a careful physician in infectious cases at the
present day; and thus, too, in course of time there was
developed the idea of the possibility of <i>disinfection</i>, an
idea as salutary as the discovery in medical science of
effective methods for the disinfection of disease. The
code of taboo had an obvious ethical value, as Dr.
Jevons pointed out long ago;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> like all discipline carried
out with a social end in view, it helped men to realise
that they were under obligations to the community of
which they were a part, and that they would be visited
by severe penalties if they neglected these duties. But
it inevitably tended to forge a set of fetters binding and
cramping the minds of its captives with a countless
number of terrors; life was full of constant anxiety, of
that feeling expressed by the later Romans in the word
<i>religio</i>,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> which, as we shall see, probably had its origin
in this period of primitive superstition. The only remedy
is the <i>discovery of the means of disinfection</i>, or, as we
commonly call it, of <i>purification</i>: a discovery which must
have been going on for ages, and only finds its completion
at Rome in the era of the City-state. We shall return
to this part of the subject when we deal with the ritual
of purification; at present we must attend to certain
survivals in that ritual which suggest that at one time
the ancestors of the Roman people lived under this
unwritten code of taboo.</p>

<p>Let us see, in the first place, how human beings were
supposed to be affected by this mysterious influence
under certain circumstances and at particular periods of
their existence. As universally in primitive life, the newborn
infant must originally have been taboo; for every
Roman child needed purification or disinfection, boys on
the ninth, girls on the eighth day after birth. This day
was called the <i>dies lustricus</i>, the day of a purificatory
rite; "est lustricus dies," says Macrobius, "<i>quo infantes
lustrantur</i> et nomen accipiunt."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> In historical times the
naming of the child was doubtless the more practically
important part of the ceremony; though we may note<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
in passing that the mystic value attaching to names, of
which there are traces in Roman usage, may have even
originally given that part a greater significance than we
should naturally attribute to it.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> Again, when the child
reaches the age of puberty, it is all the world over
believed to be in a critical or dangerous condition,
needing disinfection; of this idea, so far as I know,
the later Romans show hardly a trace, but we may
suppose that the ceremony of laying aside the <i>toga</i> of
childhood, which was accompanied by a sacrifice, was a
faint survival of some process of purification.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> Once
more, after a death the whole family had to be purified
with particular care from the contagion of the corpse,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>
which was here as everywhere taboo; a cypress bough
was stuck over the door of the house of a noble family
to give warning to any passing pontifex that he was not
to enter it;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> and those who followed the funeral cort&egrave;ge
were purified by being sprinkled with water and by stepping
over fire.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> <i>Society had effectually protected itself against
the miasma in all these cases by the discovery of the means
of disinfection.</i></p>

<p>One of the commonest forms of taboo is that on women,
who, especially at certain periods, were apparently believed
to be "infectious."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> Of this belief we have very distinct
survivals in Roman ritual, which I must here be content to
mention only, leaving details to trained anthropologists to
explain. We find them both in <i>sacra privata</i> and <i>sacra
publica</i>. Cato has preserved the formula for the propitiation
of Mars Silvanus in the private rites of the farm; it
is to take place <i>in silva</i>, and its object is the protection of
the cattle, doubtless those which have been turned out to
pasture in the forest, and are therefore in danger from
evil beasts and evil spirits. Now this <i>res divina</i> may be
performed either by a free man or a slave, <i>but no woman
may be present</i>, nor see what is going on.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> In <i>sacra
publica</i> women were excluded from the cult of Hercules
at the Ara Maxima, and were not allowed to swear by the
name of that god; facts which are usually connected with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
the doubtful identification of Hercules with Genius, or the
male principle of life.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> More conclusive evidence of taboo
in the case of women is the fact that at certain sacrifices
they were ordered to withdraw, both <i>mulieres</i> and <i>virgines</i>,
together with other persons to be mentioned directly.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
Unfortunately we are not told what those sacrifices were;
but it seems clear enough that there had been at one time
a scruple (<i>religio</i>) about admitting women of any age to
certain sacred rites. If so, it is remarkable how the good
sense of the Roman people overcame any serious disabilities
which might have been produced by such ideas;
the Roman woman gained for herself a position of dignity,
and even of authority, in her household, which had very
important results on the formation of the character of the
people.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> Traces of the old superstition doubtless continued
to survive in folklore; an example, interesting
because it seems to illustrate the positive aspect of taboo
(<i>mana</i>), may be found by the curious in Pliny's <i>Natural
History</i>, xxviii. 78.</p>

<p>Another widely-spread example of the class of ideas
we are discussing is the belief that <i>strangers</i> are dangerous.
Dr. Frazer tells us that "to guard against the baneful
influence exerted voluntarily or involuntarily by strangers
is an elementary dictate of savage prudence." You have
to disarm them of their magical powers, to counteract "the
baneful influence which is believed to emanate from them."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
Of this feeling he has collected a great number of convincing
illustrations. We find it also surviving in Roman
ritual. A note, referred to above, which has come down
to us from the learned Verrius Flaccus, informs us that at
certain sacrifices the lictor proclaimed "<i>hostis vinctus
mulier virgo exesto</i>," where <i>hostis</i> has its old meaning of
stranger.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> This is, of course, merely the old feeling of
taboo surviving in the religious ritual of the City-state, and
is also no doubt connected with the belief that the recognised
deities of a community could not be approached by any
but the members of that community; but its taproot is
probably to be found in the ideas described by Dr. Frazer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
We can illustrate it well from the ritual of another Italian
city, Iguvium in Umbria, which, as I mentioned in a note
to my last lecture, has come down to us in a very elaborate
form. In the ordinance for the <i>lustratio populi</i> of that city
the magistrate is directed to expel all members of certain
neighbouring communities by a thrice-repeated proclamation.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>
Such fear of strangers is not even yet extinct in
Italy. Professor von Duhn told me that once when
approaching an Italian village in search of inscriptions he
was taken for the devil, being unluckily mounted on a black
horse and dressed in black, and was met by a priest with
a crucifix, who was at last persuaded to "disinfect" him
with holy water as a condition of his being admitted to the
village. But the Romans of historical times, in this as in
so many other ways, discovered easy methods of overcoming
these fears and scruples: we find a good example of
this in the organised college of Fetiales, who, on entering
as envoys a foreign territory, were fully protected by their
sacred herbs, carried by a <i>verbenarius</i>, against all hostile
contamination.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>A remark seems here necessary about the apparent
inconsistency between this feeling of anxiety about
strangers and the well-known ancient Italian practice of
<i>hospitium</i>, by which two communities, or two individuals,
or an individual and a community, entered into relations
which bound them to mutual hospitality and kindness
in case of need:<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> a practice so widely spread and so
highly developed that it may be considered one of the
most valuable civilising agents in the early history of
Italy. There is, however, no real inconsistency here. In
the first place, the stranger who was removed on the
occasion of solemn public religious rites may be assumed
not to have been in possession of the <i>ius hospitii</i> with the
Roman state, and in any case it must be doubtful whether
that <i>ius</i> would give him the right of being present at all
sacrificial rites. Secondly, the researches of Dr. Westermarck
have recently, for the first time, made it clear that
both the taboo on strangers and the very widely-spread<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
practice of hospitality can ultimately be traced down to
the same root. The stranger is dangerous; but for that
very reason it is desirable to secure his good-will at once.
He may have the evil eye; but if so, it is as well to disarm
him by offering him food and drink, and, when he has
partaken of these, by entering into communion with him
in the act of partaking also yourself. Expediency would
obviously suggest some such remedy for the danger of his
presence, and this would in course of time, in accordance
with the instinct of Romans and Italians, grow into a set
of rules sanctioned by law as well as custom&mdash;the <i>ius
hospitii</i>.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p><i>Hostis vinctus mulier virgo exesto.</i> We have noticed
traces of taboo on women and strangers: what of the <i>vinctus</i>?
This is, so far as I know, the only proof we have that a
man in chains was thought to be religiously dangerous.
I am not sure how his expulsion from religious rites is to
be explained. It is, however, as well to note that criminals
were in primitive societies thought to be uncanny, probably
because the commonest of all crimes, if not the only
one affecting society as a whole, was the breaking of taboo,
which made the individual an outcast.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> And we may put
this together with the fact that in the early City-state such
outcasts were probably not kept shut up in a prison, but
allowed to wander about secured with chains; this seems a
fair inference from the power which the priest of Jupiter
(<i>Flamen Dialis</i>) possessed of releasing from his chains any
prisoner who entered his house, <i>i.e.</i> who had taken refuge
there as in an asylum.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> Thus the fettered criminal, who
was certainly not a citizen, might find his way to the place
where a sacrifice was going on, and have to submit to
expulsion together with the strangers. It is, however, also
possible that the iron of the chains, if they were of iron,
made him doubly dangerous; for, as we shall see directly,
iron was taboo, and the chains of the prisoner who took
refuge with the Flamen had to be thrown out of the house,
no doubt for this reason, by the <i>impluvium</i>.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>Turning to inanimate objects, which are supposed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
primitive man to be dangerous or taboo, we are met by a
fact which will astonish anthropologists, and which I cannot
satisfactorily explain. Blood is everywhere in the savage
world regarded with suspicion and anxiety; there is something
mysterious about it as containing (so they thought)
the life, and its colour and smell are also uncanny; horses
cannot endure it, and there are still strong men who faint
at the sight of it. Yet at Rome, so far as I can discover,
there was in historical times hardly a trace left of this
anxiety in its original form of taboo; the religious law had
effectually eliminated the various chances that might arouse
it. No student of Roman religious antiquities seems to have
noticed this singular fact. No anthropologist, as far as I
know, has observed that among the many taboos to which
the Flamen Dialis was subject, blood does not appear.
The reason no doubt is that anthropologists are not as a
rule Roman historians; their curiosity is not excited by a
fact which must have some explanation in Roman religious
history. From a single passage of Festus (p. 117) we
learn that soldiers following the triumphal car carried
laurel "ut quasi purgati a caede humana intrarent urbem";
and this is the only distinct relic of the idea that I can
find. Pliny's <i>Natural History</i>, that wonderful thesaurus
of odds and ends, affords no help; the mystic qualities of
blood are hardly alluded to there, and the same can be said
of Servius' commentary on the <i>Aeneid</i>. The word blood
is not to be found in the index to Wissowa's great work,
of which the supreme value is its accurate record of the
religious law and all the ceremonies of the State. I am
constrained to believe that the priests or priest-kings who
developed the <i>ius divinum</i> of the Roman City-state deliberately
suppressed the superstition, for reasons which it is
impossible to conjecture with certainty. And this guess,
which I put forward with hesitation, is indeed in keeping
with certain other facts of Roman life. It is doubtful
whether human sacrifice ever existed among this people;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
it is certain that the execution of citizens in civil life by
beheading was abandoned at a very early period.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
shedding of blood, except when a victim was sacrificed
under the rules of sacred law, was carefully avoided; thus
the horror of blood had a social and ethical result of value,
instead of remaining a mere <i>religio</i> (taboo). It is true
that in one or two rites, such as that of the October horse,
the blood of a sacrifice seems to have been thought to
possess peculiar powers;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> but it is at the same time noticeable
that this rite is not included in the old calendar, a
fact of which a wholly satisfactory explanation has not yet
been offered. In the Lupercalia there is a trace of the
mystic use of blood in sacrifice, but a very faint one: to this
we shall return later on. The two Luperci had their foreheads
smeared with the knife bloody from the slaughter of
the victims, but the blood was at once wiped off with wool
dipped in milk.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> This rite is of course in the old calendar;
it stands almost alone in its mystical character, and may
have been taken over by the Romans from previous inhabitants
of the site of Rome. Lastly, in the Terminalia,
or boundary-festival of arable land in country districts, the
boundary-stone was sprinkled with the blood of the victims,
showing that a spirit, or <i>numen</i>, was believed to reside in
it;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> but I cannot find that this practice survived in the
public sacrifices of the city. It is found only in the sacrifices
(<i>Graeco ritu</i>) supervised by the <i>XV viri sacris faciundis</i>
in that part of the Ludi Saeculares of Augustus which was
concerned with Greek chthonic deities in the Campus
Martius.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>Yet unquestionably there had been a time when many
inanimate objects were supposed to have a mystic or
dangerous influence; this is sufficiently proved by the long
list of taboos to which the unfortunate Flamen Dialis was
even in historical times subject. He was forbidden to
touch a goat, a dog, raw meat, beans, ivy, wheat, leavened
bread; he might not walk under a vine, and his hair and
nails might not be cut with an iron knife; and he might
not have any knot or unbroken ring about his person.
Dr. Frazer has the merit of being the first to point out the
real meaning of this strange list of disabilities, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
explain the mystic or miasmatic origin of some of them.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
They need not detain us now, as they are survivals only,
and survivals of ideas which must have been long extinct
before Roman history can be said to begin. Almost the
only one among them of which we have other traces is the
taboo on iron, which must have been of comparatively late
date, as the use of iron in Italy seems only to have begun
about the eighth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> This is found also in the
ritual of the Arval Brotherhood, the ancient agricultural
priesthood revived by Augustus, and better known to us
than any other owing to the discovery of its <i>Acta</i> in the
site of the sacred grove between Rome and Ostia. These
Brethren had originally suffered from the taboo on iron;
but in characteristic fashion they had discovered that
a piacular or disinfecting sacrifice would sufficiently atone
for its use whenever it was necessary to take a pruning-hook
within the limits of the grove.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> We may here also
recall the fact that no iron might be used in the building or
repairing of the ancient <i>pons sublicius</i>, the oldest of all the
bridges of the Tiber.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>Every one who wishes to get an idea of the nature of
taboo in primitive Rome, and of the way in which it was
got rid of, should study the disabilities of the Flamen
Dialis, and satisfy himself of their absence, with the
exception just mentioned, and possibly one or two more, in
the ritual of historical Rome. Nothing is more likely
to convince him of the way in which Roman civilisation
contrived to leave these superstitions as mere fossils, incapable
any longer of doing mischief by cramping the
conscience and inducing constant anxiety. If he is disposed
to ask why such a large number of these fossils
should be found attached to the priesthood of Jupiter, I
must ask him to let me postpone that question, which
would at this moment lead us too far afield.</p>

<p>I may, however, mention here that the Flaminica
Dialis, who was not priestess of Juno as is commonly
supposed, but assisted her husband in the cult of Jupiter,
was also subject to certain taboos. On three occasions in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
the religious year she might not appear in public with her
hair "done up," viz. the moving of the <i>ancilia</i> in March,
the festival of the Argei in March and May, and during
the cleansing of the <i>penus Vestae</i> in June. Also she might
not wear shoes made from the skin of a beast that had died
a natural death, but only from that of a sacrificial victim.
There are traces of a <i>religio</i> about shoe-leather, I may
remark, both in the Roman and in other religious systems.
Varro tells us that "in aliquot sacris et sacellis scriptum
habemus, Ne quid scorteum adhibeatur: ideo <i>ne morticinum</i>
quid adsit." Leather was taboo in the worship
of the almost unknown deity Carmenta. Petronius
describes women in the cult of Jupiter Elicius walking
barefoot; and we are reminded of the well-known rule
which still survives in Mahommedan mosques.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> The
original idea may have been that the skin of an animal
not made sacred by sacrifice might destroy the efficacy of
the worship contemplated. On the other hand, the skin
of a duly sacrificed animal had potency of a useful kind&mdash;a
fact or belief so widespread as to need no illustration
here; but we shall come upon an example of it in my
next lecture.</p>

<p>Certain <i>places</i> were also affected by the idea of taboo.
In the later religious law of the City-state the sites of
all temples, <i>i.e.</i> all places in which deities had consented
to take up their abode, were of course holy; but this is a
much more mature development, though it unquestionably
had its root in the same idea that we are now discussing.
Such sites, as we shall see in a later lecture, were <i>loca
sacra</i>, and <i>sacer</i> is a word of legal ritual, meaning that
the place has been made over to the deity by certain
formulae, accompanied with favourable auspices, under
the authority of the State.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> But there were other
holy places which were not <i>sacra</i> but <i>religiosa</i>; and
the word <i>religiosum</i> here might almost be translated
"affected by taboo." Wissowa provides us with a list of
these places, and this and the quotations he supplies with
it are of the utmost value for my present subject.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
They comprised, of course, all holy places which the
State had not duly consecrated, and therefore some which
hardly concern us here, such as shrines belonging to
families and gentes, and temple-sites in the provinces of
a later age. More to our purpose at this moment are
the spots where thunderbolts were supposed to have fallen.
Such spots were encircled with a low wall and called
<i>puteal</i> from their resemblance to a well, or <i>bidental</i> from the
sacrifice there of a lamb as a <i>piaculum</i>; the bolt was supposed
to be thus buried, and the place became <i>religiosum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>
So, too, all burial-grounds were not <i>loca sacra</i> but <i>loca
religiosa</i>, technically because they were not the property
of the state or consecrated by it; in reality, I venture to
say, because the place where a corpse was deposited was
of necessity taboo. Such places were <i>extra commercium</i>,
and their sanctity might not be violated: "religiosum
est," wrote the learned Roman Masurius Sabinus, "quod
propter sanctitatem aliquam <i>remotum et sepositum est</i> a
nobis."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> So, too, the great lawyer of Cicero's time,
Servius Sulpicius, defines <i>religio</i> as "quae propter sanctitatem
aliquam remota ac seposita a nobis sit," where he
is using <i>religio</i> in the sense of a thing or place to which
a taboo attaches.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> And again, another authority, Aelius
Gallus, said that <i>religiosum</i> was properly applied to an
object in regard to which there were things which a man
might not do: "quod si faciat," he goes on, "adversus
deorum voluntatem videatur facere."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> These last words
are in the language of the City-state; if we would go
behind it to that of an earlier age, we should substitute
words which would express the feeling or scruple, the
<i>religio</i>, without reference to any special deity. Virgil
has pictured admirably this feeling as applied to places,
in describing the visit of Aeneas to the site of the future
Rome under the guidance of his host Evander (<i>Aen.</i>
viii. 347):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p>This is a passage on which I shall have to comment
again: at present I will content myself with noting how
accurately the poet, who of all others best understood
the instincts of the less civilised Italians of his own day,
has used his knowledge to express the antique feeling
that there were places which man must shrink from
entering&mdash;a feeling far older than the invention of legal
<i>consecratio</i> by the authorities of a City-state.</p>

<p>Lastly, the principle of taboo, or <i>religio</i>, if we use
the Latin word, affected certain times as well as places.
Just as under the <i>ius divinum</i> of the fully-developed State
certain spots were made over to the deities for their
habitation and rendered inviolable by <i>consecratio</i>, so
certain days were also appointed as theirs which the
human inhabitants might not violate by the transaction
of profane business. But I have just pointed out that
the consecration of holy places in this legal fashion was
a late development of a primitive feeling or <i>religio</i>;
exactly the same, if I am not mistaken, was the case
with regard to the holy days. These were called <i>nefasti</i>,
and belong to the life of the State; but there were others,
called <i>religiosi</i>, which I believe to have been tabooed days
long before the State arose.</p>

<p>When we come to examine the ancient religious
calendar, it will be found that I shall not then be called
upon to deal with <i>dies religiosi</i>, for the very good
reason that they are not indicated in that calendar&mdash;there
is no mark for them as <i>religiosi</i>, and some of them
are not even <i>dies nefasti</i>, as we might naturally have
expected.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> What, then, is the history of them? We
may be able to make a fair guess at this by noting
exactly what these days were; Dr. Wissowa has put
them together for us in a very succinct passage.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> He
begins the list with the 18th of Quinctilis (July), on
which two great disasters had happened to Roman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
armies, the defeats on the Cremera and the Allia; and
also the 16th, the day after the Ides, because, according
to the legend, the Roman commander had sacrificed on
that day with a view to gaining the favour of the gods
in the battle. We may regard the story about the 18th
as historical; but then we are told that <i>all</i> days following
on Kalends, Nones, and Ides were likewise made <i>religiosi</i>
(or <i>atri</i>, <i>vitiosi</i>, which have the same meaning) as being
henceforward deemed unlucky by pronouncement of senate
and pontifices;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> thus all <i>dies postriduani</i>, as they were
called, were put out of use, or at any rate declared
unlucky, for many purposes, both public and private, <i>e.g.</i>
marriages, levies, battles, and sacred rites,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> simply because
on one occasion disaster had followed the offering of a
sacrifice on the 16th of Quinctilis. It is difficult to
believe that thirty-six days in the year were thus tabooed,
by a Roman senate and Roman magistrates, in a period
when the practical wisdom of the government was beginning
to be a marked characteristic of the State. Some
people, we are told, went so far as to treat the <i>fourth
day before</i> Kalends, Nones, and Ides in the same way;
but Gellius declares that he could find no tradition about
this except a single passage of Claudius Quadrigarius,
in which he said that the fourth day before the Nones of
Sextilis was that on which the battle of Cannae was
fought.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>I am strongly inclined to suggest that the traditional
explanation of the tabooing of these thirty-six, or possibly
seventy-two days was neither more nor less than an
aetiological myth, like hundreds of others which were
invented to account for Roman practices, religious and
other; and this supposition seems to be confirmed as
we go on with the list of <i>dies religiosi</i> as given by
Wissowa. The three days&mdash;Sextilis 24, October 5,
November 8&mdash;on which the Manes were believed to
come up from the underworld through the <i>mundus</i> (to
which I shall return later on) were <i>religiosi</i>;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> so were
those when the temple of Vesta remained open (June 7<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
to 15),<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> those on which the Salii performed their dances
in March and October,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> two days following the <i>feriae
Latinae</i> (a movable festival),<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> and the days of the
Parentalia in February and the Lemuria in May, which
were concerned with the cult and the memory of the
dead.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> Now the <i>religio</i> or taboo on these days obviously
springs either from a feeling of anxiety suggested by
very primitive notions of the dead and of departed
spirits; or in the case of the temple of Vesta, by some
mystical purification or disinfection preparatory to the
ingathering of the crops, which I noticed in my <i>Roman
Festivals</i> (p. 152 foll.); or again in the case of the
Salii, by some danger to the crops from evil spirits, etc.,
which might be averted by their peculiar performances.
In fact, all these <i>dies religiosi</i> date as such, we may be
pretty sure, from a very primitive period before the
genesis of the City-state, and were not recognised&mdash;for
what reason we will not at present attempt to guess&mdash;as
<i>religiosi</i> by the authorities who drew up the Calendar.
Some of them appear in that calendar as <i>dies nefasti</i>,
but not all; and I am entirely at one with Wissowa,
whose knowledge of the Roman religious law is unparalleled
for exactness, in believing that a <i>religio</i>
affecting a day had nothing whatever to do with its
character as <i>fastus</i> or <i>nefastus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>If all these last-mentioned <i>dies religiosi</i> are such
because ancient popular feeling attached the <i>religio</i> to
them, we may infer, I think, that the same was really
the case also with the <i>dies postriduani</i>. The fact that
the authorities of the State had made one or two
days <i>religiosi</i> as anniversaries of disasters, supplied a
handy explanation for a number of other <i>dies religiosi</i>
of which the true explanation had been entirely lost;
but that there was such a true explanation, resting
on very primitive beliefs, I have very little doubt.
Lucky and unlucky days are found in the unwritten
calendars of primitive peoples in many parts of the
world. An old pupil, now a civil servant in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
province of Madras, has sent me an elaborate account
of the notions of this kind existing in the minds of the
Tamil-speaking people of his district of southern India.
The Celtic calendar recently discovered at Coligny in
France contains a number of mysterious marks, some of
which may have had a meaning of this kind.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> Dr.
Jevons has collected some other examples from various
parts of the world, <i>e.g.</i> Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> The old Roman
superstition about the luckiness of odd days and the
unluckiness of even ones, which appears, as we shall see,
in the arrangement of the calendar, was probably at one
time a popular Italian notion, not derived, as used to be
thought, from Pythagoras and his school.</p>

<p>I therefore conclude that we may add times and
seasons to the list of those objects, animate and inanimate,
which were affected by the practice of taboo in primitive
Rome; and I hold that the word <i>religiosus</i>, as applied
both to times and places, exactly expresses the feeling on
which that practice is based. The word <i>religiosus</i> came to
have another meaning (though it retained the old one
as well) in historical times, and the Romans could be
called <i>religiosissimi mortalium</i> in the sense of paying
close attention to worship and all its details. But the
original meaning of <i>religio</i> and <i>religiosus</i> may after all
have been that nervous anxiety which is a special
characteristic of an age of taboo.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> To discover the
best methods of soothing that anxiety, or, in other words,
the methods of disinfection, was the work of the organised
religious life of family and State which we are going to
study. But I must first devote a lecture to another class
of primitive survivals.</p>

had so far needed special protection from evil influences (of what
kind in particular it is impossible to say) by purple-striped toga and
amulet (see below, p. 60), was now entering a stage when these
were no longer needed. All notions of taboo seem to have vanished.</p></div>

the release of Sinon from his bonds by King Priam is compared with
that of the prisoner who enters the flaminia (house of the Flamen
Dialis). That there was something in the iron which interfered with
the religious efficacy of the Flamen seems likely; cp. the rule that
he might wear no ring unless it were broken, and have no knot about
his dress. But the latter restriction suggests that binding may have
been originally the object of the taboo (cp. Ovid, <i>Fasti</i>, v. 432), and
that the iron taboo came in with the iron age. Appel, <i>de Romanorum

agree with Wissowa (<i>R.K.</i> p. 354, where references are given for the
opposite opinion) that there is no evidence for human sacrifice in the
old Roman religion or law, except in the rule that a condemned
criminal was made over to a deity (<i>sacer</i>), which may have been a
legal survival of an original form of actual sacrifice. The alleged
sacrifice by Julius Caesar of two mutinous soldiers in the Campus
Martius (Dio Cass. xliii. 24) is of the same nature as the sacrifice of
captives to Orcus in <i>Aen.</i> xi. 81, <i>i.e.</i> it is outside of the civil life and
religious law; this is shown in the latter case by the mention of
blood in the ritual (<i>caeso sparsurus sanguine flammas</i>), and in the
former by the beheading of the mutineers.</p></div>

but the axe disappeared from the fasces in the city with the abolition

cp. the rule of XII. Tables, "mulieres genas ne radunto," <i>i.e.</i> at
funerals, Cic. <i>de Legibus</i>, ii. 59, and Serv. <i>Aen.</i> iii. 67 from Varro,

<h4>LECTURE III</h4>

<h5>ON THE THRESHOLD OF RELIGION: MAGIC</h5>


<p>Taboo, the traces of which at Rome we examined in the
last lecture, is, as we saw, closely allied to magic, even if
it be not, as Dr. Frazer thinks, magic in a negative form.
We have now to see what traces are to be found of magic
in the proper or usual sense of the word&mdash;active or positive
magic, as we may call it. By this we are to understand
the exercise of a mysterious mechanical power by an
individual on man, spirit, or deity, to enforce a certain
result. In magic there is no propitiation, no prayer.
"He who performs a purely magical act," says Dr.
Westermarck,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> "utilises such mechanical power without
making any appeal at all to the will of a supernatural
being." Religion, on the other hand, is an attitude of
regard and dependence; in a religious stage man feels
himself in the hands of a supernatural power with whom
he desires to be in right relation.</p>

<p>If we accept this distinction, as I think we may
(though one school of anthropologists is hardly disposed
to do so), it is plain that magical practices are of a
totally different kind from religious practices, as being
the result of a different mental attitude towards the
supernatural; they belong to a ruder and more rudimentary
idea of the relation of Man to the Power
manifesting itself in the universe. True, they have
their origin in the same kind of human experience, in
the difficulties man meets with in his struggle for
existence, and his desire to overcome these; but unlike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
religion, magic is a wholly inadequate attempt to
overcome them. This inadequacy was long ago well
explained by Dr. Jevons.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> He showed that man in
that early stage of his experience did not understand
the true relation of cause and effect; that, "turned loose
as it were among innumerable possible causes (of a given
effect), with nothing to guide his choice, the chances
against his making the right choice were considerable."
As a matter of fact he usually made the wrong one, and
is still apt to do so. There is probably more magic
going on behind the scenes even in civilised countries,
and more especially both in Greece and Italy, than either
men of science or men of religion have any idea of. In
its various forms as they are now classified,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> <i>e.g.</i> contagious
magic, and homoeopathic magic, the exercise of the
mysterious will-power, real or imaginary, is to be found
all the world over, accompanied usually with a spell or
incantation which is believed to enforce and increase that
power&mdash;a kind of telepathy, which seems to be the psychological
basis, so far as there is one, of the whole system.
In these rites the virtue resides in some action, which,
together with the spell or incantation, enforces the desired
result by calling out the will-power, or <i>mana</i>, if we adopt
the convenient Melanesian word lately brought into
use. Whatever percentage of psychological truth may
lie at the root of such performances, it is obvious that
they must in the main be wholly inadequate, and must
constantly tend to pass into mere quackery and become
discredited; and it was the special function of the religious
organisation of early society to eliminate and discredit
them.</p>

<p>But it was a long stage in the evolution of society
before man arrived at a better knowledge of his relation
to the Power manifesting itself in the universe; before he
reached the idea of a god or spirit realisable and nameable,
and thus capable of being addressed, placated,
worshipped. When this stage is reached, there supervenes
almost always a strong tendency to regulate and systematise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
the methods of address, placation, and worship; and
among some peoples, <i>e.g.</i> the Romans, for reasons which
it is by no means easy to explain, this tendency is much
stronger than among others. Wherever it has been strong,
wherever these methods of putting oneself in right relation
with the Power have been systematised by a central
authority or priesthood, and thus made into religious law,
there, as we might naturally expect, the performances and
performers of magic have been most vigorously discountenanced
and outlawed. The interests of religion
and its officials are wholly antagonistic to those of magic
and magicians. In civilised communities and in historical
times magic is in the main individualistic, not social;
magical ceremonies for the good of the community seem
to be confined to races in a very early stage of development.
The examples on which Dr. Frazer relies
for his theory of the development of the public magician
into a king<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> are of this primitive kind, or are mere survivals
of magic in a higher stage of civilisation&mdash;such
survivals as there will always be among forms and
ceremonies, of which it is man's nature to be tenacious.
But religion, once firmly established, invariably seeks to
exclude magic; and the priest does his best to discredit
the magician, as claiming to exercise mysterious
powers outside the pale of the legally recognised methods
of propitiation and worship. As Dr. Tylor observed
long ago, the more civilised the race, the more apt it is to
associate magic with men of inferior civilisation.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> In the
Jewish law, though magic was well known to the Jews
and privately practised, there is no recognition of it; the
magical books attributed to Solomon were suppressed,
according to tradition, by the pious king Hezekiah.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> So
too at Rome, where the outward forms of religion were
also very highly systematised, magic, as it seems to me,
was rigorously excluded from the State ritual, though it
continued in use in private life under certain precautions
taken by the State; in the few genuine examples of it in
the rites belonging to the <i>ius divinum</i> (<i>i.e.</i> those used and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
sanctioned for the purposes of the community), it is
nothing more than a survival of which the magical meaning
was unknown to the writers from whom we hear of it.</p>

<p>A good example of such survivals is the curious ceremony
of the <i>aquaelicium</i>, without doubt a genuine case of
magical "rain-making"&mdash;one of the many inadequate and
blundering attempts on the part of primitive man to obtain
what he needs. Probably it may be classed under the
head of "sympathetic magic," but the evidence as to
what was done in the ceremony is not quite explicit
enough to allow us to do this confidently.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> It was, of
course, not included in the religious calendar, as it would
be only occasionally called for, and could not be fixed
to a day; but there is clear evidence that it was
sanctioned by the State, for the pontifices took part in
it, and the magistrates without the <i>toga praetexta</i>, and
the lictors carrying the fasces reversed.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> A stone, which
lay outside the walls near the Porta Capena, was brought
into the city by the pontifices, so far as we can make out
the details, and it has been conjectured that it was taken
to an altar of Jupiter Elicius on the Aventine hard by,
this cult-title of the god of the sky having possibly some
relation to the technical name of the ceremony. What
was done with the stone we unluckily do not know; but
it has been reasonably conjectured that it was a hollow
one, and that it was filled with water which was allowed
to run over the edge, as a means of inducing the rain-god
to suffer the heavens to overflow.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> It was called <i>lapis
manalis</i>; and the epithet here can have nothing to do
with the Manes, as in the case of another <i>lapis manalis</i>,
of which I shall have a word to say later on, but must
mean "pouring" or "overflowing." One or two other
fragments of evidence point in the same direction, and
I think we may fairly conclude that the rite was originally
one of sympathetic magic&mdash;that as the stone overflowed,
so the sky would pour down rain. In my <i>Roman
Festivals</i> I have pointed out a remarkable parallel to this
in the collections of the <i>Golden Bough</i>; in a Samoan village<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
a stone represented the god of rain, and in a drought his
priests carried it in procession and dipped it in a stream.</p>

<p>This parallel I owe to Dr. Frazer's wide knowledge of
all such practices among savage peoples. But this ever
helpful and friendly guide, in treating of the Jupiter
Elicius concerned in this ceremony, has gone beyond the
evidence, and attributed to the Romans another kind of
magic of which I believe they were quite innocent. He
has been led to this by his theory that kings were
developed out of successful magicians. In his lectures on
the early history of the Kingship<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> he maintains that
the Roman kings practised the magical art of bringing
down lightning from heaven. "The priestly king Numa
passed for an adept in the art of drawing down lightning
from the sky.... Tullus Hostilius is reported to have
met with the same end (as Salmoneus, king of Elis)
in an attempt to draw down Jupiter in the form of
lightning from the clouds." To support these statements
Dr. Frazer quotes Pliny, Livy, Ovid, Plutarch, Arnobius,
Aurelius Victor, and Zonaras&mdash;truly a formidable list
of authorities; but without any attempt to discover where
any of these late writers found the stories. Yet he had
but to read Aust's admirable article "Jupiter" in the
<i>Mythological Lexicon</i><a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> to assure himself that legends
which cannot be traced farther back than the middle of
the second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> cannot seriously be assumed to
be genuinely Roman. Pliny happens to mention
Calpurnius Piso as his authority; this was the man
who is well known in Roman history as the author of
the first <i>lex de repetundis</i> of the year 149 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, a good
statesman, but as an annalist much given to indulging
a mythological fancy.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> We happen to know that he
wrote with happy confidence about the life and habits
of Romulus, and a story about wine-drinking which he
attributes to that king is obviously transferred to him
from some more historical personage. Romulus would
not drink wine one day because he was going to be
very busy on the next. Then they said to him, "If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
we all did so, Romulus, wine would be cheap." "Nay,
dear," he replied, "if every one drank as much as he
wished; and that is exactly what I am doing."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> I
quote the story simply as a good example of the way
in which Roman historians could deal with their kings,
and of the absolute necessity of acquainting oneself with
their methods before building hypotheses upon their
statements. I hardly need to add that another of Dr.
Frazer's authorities, Arnobius, informs us that he took
the story from the second book of Valerius Antias, a
later writer than Piso, whose name is a byword even
with the uncritical Livy for shameless exaggeration and
mis-statement.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>But how did these writers come by such legends,
which, as Dr. Frazer shows, are to be found also in
Greece and in other parts of the world? Why should
they have wished to make Roman kings into magicians?
Rain-making we can understand at Rome,&mdash;it had a
practical end in view, the procuring of rain for the crops,&mdash;but
why lightning and thunder, which were so much
dreaded that every bit of damage done by a thunderstorm
had to be carefully expiated by a religious process?
Rome is not in the tropics, where rain and thunder so
often come together, and where an attempt to produce
rain by magic might naturally include thunder, as in
some of Dr. Frazer's examples from tropical lands. I
entirely agree with the latest and most sober investigators
of Roman ritual that this kind of magic is quite foreign
to Roman ideas and practice;<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> there is no vestige of it
in the Roman cult; these stories must have come from
outside. And there is every probability that they came
from Etruria, where the lore of lightning had become a
pseudo-science, a waste of human ingenuity, for the origin
of which we must look, as we are now beginning to
understand, to Babylonia and the Eastern magic.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> The
Jupiter Elicius of the Aventine had nothing to do with
lightning; he took his cult-title from the rite of <i>aquaelicium</i>;
but as soon as the Romans began to interest themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
in the Etruscan lightning-lore, of which this electrical
magic was only a part,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> they perverted the meaning
of the epithet to suit their new studies, and began to
attribute to their legendary kings powers which properly
belonged to Etruscan or Oriental magicians. The second
century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, when Piso wrote his <i>Annals</i>, is exactly the
period when we should naturally expect such studies
to come into fashion, and with such perversions of
"history" as their consequence.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p>I go on to note one or two more examples of real
magic in the State religion; but they are hard to find.
Pliny tells that even in his day people believed that a
runaway slave who had not escaped out of the city might
be arrested by a spell uttered by the Vestal virgins.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> I
take this to mean that any one who had lost his slave
might get the Vestals to use the spell as a means of
keeping the runaway within the city. The word for spell
is here <i>precatio</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a prayer, not <i>carmen</i>, which is the
usual word for a spell; and Pliny evidently thinks of
it as addressed to some god. But no doubt it was
originally at least a genuine spell, of the same kind as
others used in private life, which we shall notice directly;
and it implies a belief in some magical power inherent
in the Vestals, of whom we are told that if they accidentally
met a criminal being led to punishment they might
secure his release.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> As the spell in this case seems to be
telepathic, <i>i.e.</i> an exercise of will-power projected from a
distance, it may perhaps be paralleled with certain mystical
powers exercised by women, especially when their husbands
are at war, among some savage peoples;<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> but we have
no information about it beyond the passage in Pliny, and
further guessing would be useless.</p>

<p>This last is a case of genuine magic, but it is outside
the ritual of the State, though exercised by a State
priesthood. Within that ritual there is one other very
curious case of what must be classed as a magical process,
and one that has accidentally become famous. At
the Lupercalia on February 15, the two young men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
called Luperci, or, more strictly, belonging respectively as
leaders to the two collegia of Luperci, girt themselves
with the skins of the slaughtered victims, which were
goats, and then ran round the base of the Palatine hill,
striking at all the women who came near them or offered
themselves to their blows, with strips of skin cut from the
hides of these same victims. The object was to produce
fertility; on this point our authorities are explicit.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> Thus
this particular feature of the whole extraordinary ritual
of the Lupercalia is unmistakably within the region of
magic rather than of religion. Some potency was
believed to work in the act of striking, though apparently
without a spoken spell or <i>carmen</i>, such as usually accompanies
acts of this kind; and this part of the rite,
grotesque though it was, was allowed to survive by the
grave religious authorities who drew up the calendar of
religious festivals. It was probably a superstition too
deeply rooted in the minds of the people to admit of
being excluded; and, strange to say, it survived, in outward
form at least, until Rome had become cosmopolitan
and even Christian. The Lupercalia has always been
a puzzle to students of early religion, and as each new
theory is advanced, this strange festival is seized on for
fresh interpretation;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> but for our present purposes it
must suffice to point out that we clearly find embedded
in it a piece of genuine magic, dating beyond doubt from
a very primitive stage of thought.</p>

<p>There is one other very curious performance, occurring
each year on the ides of May, which in my view is rather
magical than religious, though the ancients themselves
looked upon it as a kind of purification: I mean the
casting into the Tiber from the <i>pons sublicius</i> of twenty-four
or twenty-seven straw puppets by the Vestal virgins,
in the presence of the magistrates and pontifices. Recently
an attempt has been made by Wissowa to prove that this
strange ceremony was not primitive, but simply a case of
the substitution of puppets for real human victims as late
as the age of the Punic wars.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> These puppets were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
called Argei, which word naturally suggests Greeks; and
Wissowa has contrived to persuade himself not only that
a number of Greeks were actually put to death by
drowning in an age when everything Greek was beginning
to be reverenced at Rome, but (still more extraordinary to
an anthropologist) that the primitive device of substitution
was had in requisition at that late date in order to
carry on the memory of the ghastly deed. And the
world of German learning has silently followed their
leader, without taking the trouble to test his conclusions
by a careful and independent examination of the evidence.
It happens that this fascinating puzzle of the Argei was
the first curiosity that enticed me into the study of the
Roman religion, and for some thirty years I have been
familiar with every scrap of evidence bearing on it; and
after going over that evidence once more I can emphatically
state my conviction that Wissowa's theory will not
hold water for a moment. I shall return to the subject
in a later lecture dealing with the religious history of
the second Punic war; at present I merely express a
belief that, whatever be the history of the accessories
of the rite,&mdash;and they are various and puzzling,&mdash;the
actual immersion of the puppets is the survival of a
primitive piece of sympathetic magic, the object being
possibly to procure rain. It is, in my opinion, quite
impossible to resist the anthropological evidence for this
conclusion, though we cannot really be certain about the
object; for this evidence I must refer you to my <i>Roman
Festivals</i>, and to the references there given.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>This rite of the Argei, then, was a case of genuine
magic, and exercised by a State priesthood, virgins to whom
certain magical powers were supposed to be attached; it
was, I think, a popular performance, like one or two others
which are also outside the limit of the Fasti,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> and was
embodied in a more complicated ceremonial long after that
calendar had been drawn up. In the ritual authorised by
the State, with public objects in view, <i>i.e.</i> for the benefit of
society as a whole, there is hardly a trace of anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
that we can call genuine magic apart from the examples I
have just been explaining. There were, I need not say,
many survivals of magical processes of which the true
magical intent had long been lost&mdash;ancient magical deposits
in a social stratum of religion, which I shall notice in their
proper place. This is not peculiar to the religion of the
Romans; it is a phenomenon to be found in all religions, even
in those of the most highly developed type, and it is one apt
to cause some confusion as to the true distinction between
magic and religion.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> It is easy to find magical processes
even in Christian worship, if we have the will to do so;
but if we steadily bear in mind that the true test of
magic is not the nature of an act, but the intent or volition
which accompanies it, the search will not be an easy
one.</p>

<p>The modern French school of sociologists, which
now has to be reckoned with in investigating the early
history of religion, claims that magic was not originally,
as we now see it, a matter of individual skill, but a sociological
fact, <i>i.e.</i> it was used for the benefit of the community,
as religion came to be in a later age. If this be true, as
it very possibly is, we see at once how the dead bones of
magical processes might survive, with their original
meaning entirely lost, into an age in which higher and
more reasonable ideas had been developed about the
relation of Man to the Power manifesting itself in the
universe. To take a single example from Rome, divination
by the examination of a victim's entrails was
originally a magical process, according to the opinion of
most modern authorities;<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> but it ceases to be magic
when it is used simply to determine in the State ritual
whether in a religious process the victim is perfect and
agreeable to the deity. In fact magical formulae, magical
instruments, unless they are used in the true spirit of
magic, to compel, not to propitiate a deity, are no longer
magic, and may be passed over here. When we come to
discuss the ritual of sacrifice and prayer, of <i>lustratio</i>, of
vows, of divination, we may find it necessary to recall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
what has here been said. On the whole, we may conclude
that organised religious cult, from its very nature and
object, everywhere excluded magic in the true sense of the
word; it implies prayer and propitiation, both of which
are absolutely inconsistent with the object and methods of
magic. Religion is the product of a higher stage of
social development; it is the expression of a real advance
of human thought; and in telling the story of the
religious experience of the Roman people we are but
indirectly concerned with those more rude and rudimentary
ideas which it displaced.</p>

<p>But in private life, outside of the organised cult of the
State and the family, magic was all through Roman
history abundant, even over-abundant, and in this form I
cannot pass it over entirely. Though the State authorities
seem to have taken pains to exclude it rigidly from
the public rites, and though there is little trace of it in
the religious life of family and gens, yet there is evidence
that it was deeply rooted in the nature of the people,
and that they must have passed through an age in which
it was an important factor in their social life. This fact,
taken together with its almost complete elimination from
the public religion, throws into relief the persistent efforts
of the State authorities, from the framing of the old
religious calendar to the time of the Augustan revival, to
keep their relations with the Power clear of all that they
believed to be unworthy or injurious. No better example
can be found of the inherent antagonism between religion
and magic.</p>

<p>Private magic may be divided into two kinds, according
as it was used to damage another, or only to benefit
oneself. In the former case the State interfered to protect
the person threatened with damage, and treated this
kind of magic as a crime. The commonest form of it
was that of the spell, or <i>carmen</i>, no doubt often sung, and
accompanied by some action which would bring it under
the head of sympathetic magic; but the spell alone is
taken cognisance of by the State. Pliny has preserved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
three words from the XII. Tables which tell their own
tale: "qui fruges excantassit."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> Servius, commenting on
the line of Virgil's 8th <i>Eclogue</i>, "atque satas alio vidi
traducere messes," writes, "magicis quibusdam artibus hoc
fiebat, unde est in XII. Tabb. 'Neve alienam segetem
pellexeris.'" These last words, with the verb in the second
person, are probably not quoted exactly from the ancient
text,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> but they help to show us the nature of this hostile
spell. There must have been a belief that the spirit, or
life, or fructifying power of your neighbour's crops could
be enticed away and transferred to your own. This is
confirmed by a remark of St. Augustine in the <i>de Civitate
Dei</i>;<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> after quoting the same line from Virgil, he adds,
"eo quod hac pestifera scelerataque doctrina fructus alieni
in alias terras transferri perhibentur, nonne in XII. Tabulis,
id est Romanorum antiquissimis legibus, Cicero commemorat
esse conscriptum et ei qui hoc fecerit supplicium
constitutum?" Given the belief, the temptation can be
well understood if we reflect that the arable land of the
old Romans was divided in sections of a square, and that
each man's allotment would have that of a neighbour on
two sides at least.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> If one man's corn were found to be
more flourishing than that of his neighbours, what more
likely than that he should have enticed away the spirit of
their crops? The process reminds us, as it reminded
Pliny, of the <i>evocatio</i> of the gods of foreign communities,
a rite which belongs to religion and not to magic, though
it doubtless had its origin in the same class of ideas as
the <i>excantatio</i>.</p>

<p>In more general terms the old Roman law (<i>i.e.</i> originally
the <i>ius divinum</i>) forbade the use of evil spells, as we
see in another fragment of the Tables, "qui malum carmen
incantassit." In later times this was usually taken as
referring to libel and slander, but there can be no doubt
that the carmina here alluded to were originally magical,
and became <i>carmina famosa</i> in the course of legal interpretation.
Cicero seems to combine the two meanings in
the <i>de Rep.</i> (iv. 10. 2) when he says that the Tables made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
it a capital offence "si quis occentavisset, sive carmen
condidisset quod infamiam faceret flagitiumve alteri" (to
bring shame or criminal reproach on another). In the
later sense these carmina have a curious history, into
which I cannot enter now.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> In the earlier sense they
existed and flourished without doubt, in spite of the law;
or it may be that, as the words of the Tables were interpreted
in the new sense, the old form of offence was
tolerated in private. "We are all afraid," says Pliny, "of
being 'nailed' (<i>defigi</i>) by spells and curses" (<i>diris precationibus</i>).<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>
These <i>dirae</i>, and all the various forms of
love-charms, <i>defixiones</i>, accompanied by the symbolic
actions which are found all the world over, lie outside my
present subject, and are so familiar to us all in Roman
literature that I do not need to dwell on them.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p>Nor of the common harmless kind of magic need I say
much now. It survived, of course, alongside of the
religion of the family and State, from the earliest times to
the latest, as it survives at the present day in all countries
civilised and uncivilised; and being harmless the State
took no heed of it. Some assortment of charms and
spells for the cure of diseases will be found in Cato's book
on agriculture, and one or two incidentally occur in that
of Varro.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> They performed the work of insurance against
both fire and accident, and even such a man as Julius
Caesar was not independent of such arts. Pliny tells us
that after experiencing a carriage accident he used to

<p>Another kind of harmless magic, to which the Romans,
like all Italians ancient and modern, were peculiarly
addicted, is the use of amulets. Here there is no spell, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
obvious and expressed exercise of will-power on the part
of the individual, but the potent influence, <i>mana</i>, or whatever
we choose to call it, resides in a material object
which brings good luck, like the cast horse-shoe of our
own times, or protects against hostile will-power, and
especially against the evil eye. This curious and widely-spread
superstition was probably the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of most
of the amulets worn or carried by Romans. A modern
Italian, even if he be a complete sceptic and materialist,
will probably be found to have some amulet about him
against the evil eye, "just to be on the safe side."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> A
list of amulets, both Greek and Roman, will be found in
the <i>Dictionary of Antiquities</i>, and in Pauly-Wissowa, <i>Real-Encyclop&auml;die,
s.v.</i> "amulet," and it is not necessary here to
explain the various kinds in use in Italy; but I must
dwell for a moment on one type, which had been taken
up into the life of the family, and in one sense into that
of the State, viz. the <i>bulla</i> worn by children, both boys
and girls.</p>

<p>The bulla was a small object, enclosed in historical
times in a capsule, and suspended round the child's neck.
It was popularly believed to have been originally an
Etruscan custom,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> and borrowed by the Romans, like so
many other ornaments. It is, however, much more probable
that the custom was old Italian (as indeed the
"medicine-bag" is world-wide), and that the Etruscan
contribution to it was merely the case or capsule, which
was of gold where the family could afford it&mdash;gold itself
being supposed to have some potency as a charm.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> The
object within the case was, as Pliny tells us, a <i>res turpicula</i>
as a rule,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> and this may remind us that a <i>fascinum</i>
was carried in the car of the triumphator as <i>medicus
invidiae</i>, to use Pliny's pregnant expression. The
triumphing general needed special protection; he appeared
in the guise of Jupiter himself, and was for the
moment lifted above the ordinary rank of humanity.
Some feeling of the same kind must have originally suggested
similar means for the protection of children under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
the age of puberty. They also wore the <i>toga praetexta</i>,
which, though associated by us with secular magistrates,
had undoubtedly a religious origin. There are distinct
signs that children were in some sense sacred, and at the
same time that they needed special protection against the
all-abounding evil influences to be met with in daily life.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>
Thus this particular form of amulet became a recognised
institution of family life, and in due time little more than
a mark of childhood.</p>

<p>Yet another kind of charm must be mentioned here
which was used at certain festivals, though apparently not
at any of those belonging to the authorised calendar. At
the Compitalia, Paganalia, and <i>feriae Latinae</i> we are told
that small images of the human figure, or masks, or simply
round balls (<i>pilae</i>), were hung up on trees or doorways,
and left to swing in the wind.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> At the Compitalia the
images had a special name, <i>maniae</i>, of which the meaning
is lost; but inasmuch as the charms were hung up at
cross-roads on that occasion, where the Lares compitales
of the various properties had their shrine, it was not
difficult to manufacture out of them a goddess, Mania,
mother of the Lares.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> The common word for these
figures was <i>oscilla</i>, and the fact of their swinging in the
wind suggested a verb <i>oscillare</i>, which survives in our own
tongue with the same meaning. Until lately it used to
be believed that they were substitutes for original human
sacrifices: a view for which there is not a particle of
evidence, though it was originated by Roman scholars.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>
Modern anthropology has found another explanation,
which is by no means improbable. Dr. Frazer, in an
appendix to the 2nd volume of the <i>Golden Bough</i>, has
collected a number of examples of the practice of swinging
<i>by human beings</i> as a magical rite; they come from many
parts of the world, including ancient Athens, and even
modern Calabria. He also points out that at the <i>feriae
Latinae</i> the swingers seem to have been human beings, if
we accept the evidence of Festus, <i>s.v.</i> "oscillantes"; thus
we are left with the possibility that the oscilla were really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
imitations of men and women, though not of human
sacrificial victims.</p>

<p>Dr. Frazer is obviously hard put to it to explain the
original meaning and object of this curious custom. In the
Paganalia, as described by Virgil in the second <i>Georgic</i>,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>
the object would seem to be the prosperity of the vine-crop.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">coloni</span>
<span class="i0">versibus incomptis ludunt risuque soluto,</span>
<span class="i0">oraque corticibus sumunt horrenda cavatis,</span>
<span class="i0">et te Bacche vocant per carmina laeta, tibique</span>
<span class="i0">oscilla ex alta suspendunt mollia pinu.</span>
<span class="i0">hinc omnis largo pubescit vinea fetu, etc.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But here we must leave a question which is still unsolved.
All we can say is that the old idea of substitutes for human
sacrifice must be finally given up, and that the <i>oscilla</i>,
whether or not they were substitutes for human swingers,
were probably charms intended to ward off evil influences
from the crops. I am not disposed to put any confidence
in what Servius tells us, that this was a purification by
means of air, just as fire and water were also purifying
agents; this looks like the ingenious explanation of a
later and a religious age.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>So much, then, for magical charms and spells, and the
survivals of them in the fully developed Roman religion.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>
It might seem hardly worth while to spend even so much
time on them as I have done, and I cannot deny that I
am glad now to be able to leave them. My object has
simply been to show how little of this kind of practice,
which meets us on the threshold of religion, was allowed
to survive by the religious authorities of the State; in
other words, I wished to make clear that in our inquiries
into the nature of the Roman religion it is really religion
and not magic that we have to do with.</p>

<p>It is really religion; it is desire, beginning already to
be effective, to be in right relation to the Power manifesting
itself in the universe. The Romans, as I hope to
show in the next lecture, when we can begin to know
and feel an interest in them, had not only begun to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
recognise this Power in various forms and functions as one
that must be propitiated, because they were dependent on it
for their daily needs, but to regulate and make permanent
the methods of propitiation. What was the relation
between this simple religion and morality&mdash;between ritual
and conduct&mdash;is a very difficult question, to which I
shall return later on. Dr. Westermarck has recently come
to the conclusion that the religion of primitive man has
no true relation to morality, that it is not apt to give a
sanction to good action, or to develop the germs of a
conscience. But so far as I can discern, the idea of active
duty, and therefore the germ of conscience, must have
been so intimately connected with the religious practice of
the old Latin family that it is to me impossible to think
of the one apart from the other. Surely it is in that life
that the famous word "<i>pius</i>" must have originated, which
throughout Roman history meant the sense of duty
towards family, State, and gods, as every reader of the
<i>Aeneid</i> knows. That the formalised religion of later times
had become almost entirely divorced from morality there
is indeed no doubt; but in the earliest times, in the old
Roman family and then in the budding State, the whole
life of the Roman seems to me so inextricably bound up
with his religion that I cannot possibly see how that
religion can have been distinguishable from his simple
idea of duty and discipline.</p>

here draw attention to the almost dogmatic conclusions of the modern
French sociological school of research; <i>e.g.</i> M. Huvelin, in <i>L'Ann&eacute;e
sociologique</i> for 1907, begins by asserting as a fundamental law,
proved by MM. Hubert et Mauss, that magic is just as much a social
fact as religion: "Les uns et les autres sont des produits de l'activit&eacute;
collective" (<i>Magie et droit individuel</i>, p. 1). But M. Huvelin's paper
is to some extent a modification of this dogma. He seeks to explain
the fact that magic is both secret and private, not public and social,
in historical times; and in the domain of law, with which he is
specially concerned, he concludes that "a magical rite is only a
religious rite twisted from its proper social end, and employed to
realise the will or belief of an individual" (p. 46). This is the only
form in which we shall find magic at Rome, except in so far as a few
of its forms survive in the ritual of religion with their meaning
changed. In early Roman law, as a quasi-religious body of rules and
practices, there are a few magical survivals which will be found
mentioned by M. Huvelin in this article; but they are of no importance
for our present subject.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_107_107" id="Footnote_107_107"></a><a href="#FNanchor_107_107"><span class="label">107</span></a> Thus Messrs. Hubert et Mauss (<i>M&eacute;langes d'histoire des
religions</i>, Preface, p. xxiv.) maintain that there is no real antinomy
between "les faits du syst&egrave;me magique et les faits du syst&egrave;me
religieux." There is in every rite, they insist, a magical as well as a
religious element. Yet on the same page we find that they exclude
magic from all organised cult, because it is not obligatory, and cannot
(if I understand them rightly) be laid down in a code, like religious
practice. I think it would have been simpler to consider the magical
element in religious rites as surviving, with its original meaning lost,
from an earlier stage of thought. M. van Gennep, in his interesting
work <i>Les Rites de passage</i>, p. 17, goes so far as to call all religious
<i>ceremonies</i> magical, as distinguished from the <i>theories</i> (<i>e.g.</i> animism)
which constitute religion. This seems to me apt to bring confusion
into the discussion; for all rites are the outward expression of thought,
and it is by the thought (or, as he calls it, theories) that we must trace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
the sociological development of mankind, the rites being used as
indexes only. I cannot but think that (as indeed in these days is
quite natural) this French school lays too much stress upon the
outward acts, and that this tendency has led them to find real living
magic where it is present only in a fossil state.</p></div>

<h4>LECTURE IV</h4>

<h5>THE RELIGION OF THE FAMILY</h5>


<p>Some of the survivals mentioned in the last two lectures
seem to carry us back to a condition of culture anterior
to the family and to the final settlement on the land.
Some attempt has recently been made to discover traces
of descent by the mother in early Latium;<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> if this could
be proved, it would mean that the Latins were already in
Latium before they had fully developed the patriarchal
system on which the family is based. However this
may be, the first real fact that meets us in the religious
experience of the Romans is the attitude towards the
supernatural, or "the Power that manifests itself in the
Universe," of the family as settled down upon the land.
The study of religion in the family, as we know it in historical
times, is also that of the earliest organisation of
religion, and of the most permanent type of ancient Italian
religious thought. Aust, whose book on the Roman
religion is the most masterly sketch of the subject as yet
published, writes thus of this religion of the family:<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>
"Here the limits of religion and superstition vanish ... and
in vain we seek here for the boundary marks of various
epochs." By the first of these propositions he means that
the State has not here been at work, framing a <i>ius divinum</i>,
including religion and excluding magic; in the family,
magic of all kinds would be admissible alongside of the
daily worship of the family deities, and thus the family
would represent a kind of half-way house between the age
of magic and all such superstitions, and the age of the rigid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
regulation of worship by the law of a City-state. By the
second proposition he means that the religious experience
of the family is far simpler, and therefore far less liable to
change than that of the State. Greek forms and ideas of
religion, for example, hardly penetrated into its worship:<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>
new deities do not find their way in&mdash;the family experience
did not call for them as did that of the State. It may be
said without going beyond the truth that the religion of
the family remained the same in all essentials throughout
Roman history, and the great priesthoods of the State
never interfered with it in any such degree as to affect its
vitality.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></p>

<p>But in order to understand the religion of the family,
we must have some idea of what the family originally
was. When a stock or tribe (<i>populus</i>) after migration
took possession of a district, it was beyond doubt divided
into clans, <i>gentes</i>, which were the oldest kinship divisions
in Italian society. All members of a clan had the same
name, and were believed to descend from a common
ancestor.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> According to the later juristic way of putting
it, all would be in the <i>patria potestas</i> of that ancestor supposing
that no deaths had ever occurred in the gens; and,
indeed, the idea that the gens is immortal in spite of the
deaths of individuals is one which constitutes it as a
permanent entity, and gives it a quasi-religious sanction.
For primitive religion, as has been well said, disbelieves
in death; most of the lower races believe both in a
qualified immortality and in the non-reality or unnaturalness
of death.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> In regard to the kinship of a clan,
death at any rate has no effect: the bond of union never
breaks.</p>

<p>Now a little reflection will show that a clan or gens of
this kind might be maintained intact in a nomadic state,
or during any number of migrations; it is, in fact, manifestly
appropriate to such a mobile condition of society,
and expresses its natural need of union; and when the
final settlement occurs, this body of kin will hold together
in the process, whether or no it has smaller divisions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
within it. We may be certain that this was the one
essential kin-division of the Latin stock when it settled in
Latium, and all through Roman history it continues so,
a permanent entity though families may die.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> Every
Roman lawyer will recognise this fact as true, and I need
not dwell on it now.</p>

<p>It is when the gens has settled upon the land that the
family begins to appear as a fact of importance for our
purpose. Such operations as the building of a permanent
house, the clearing and cultivation of a piece of land, can
best be carried out by a smaller union than the gens, and
this smaller union is ready to hand in the shape of a
section of the gens comprising the living descendants of a
<i>living</i> ancestor, whether of two, three, or even four generations.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>
This union, clearly visible to mortal eye, and
realisable in every-day work, settles together in one
house, tends its own cattle and sheep, cultivates its own
land with the help of such dependants as it owns, slave or
other, and is known by the word <i>familia</i>. This famous
word, so far as we know, does not contain the idea of
kinship, at any rate as its leading connotation; it is
inseparable from the idea of land-settlement,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> and is
therefore essentially <i>das Hauswesen</i>, the house itself,
with the persons living in it, free or servile, and with their
land and other property, all governed and administered
by the paterfamilias, the master of the household, who is
always the oldest living male ancestor. The familia is
thus an economic unit, developed out of the gens, which is
a unit of kin and little more. And thus the religion of the
familia will be a religion of practical utility, of daily work, of
struggle with perils to which the shepherd and the tiller of
the soil are liable; it is not the worship of an idea of kinship
expressed in some dimly conceived common ancestor; the
familia, as I hope to show, had no common ancestor who
could be the object of worship, except that of the gens
from which it had sprung. The life of the familia was a
realisation of the present and its needs and perils, without
the stimulus to take much thought about the past, or indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
about the future; for it, sufficient for the day was the
evil thereof; for what had been and what was to come it
could look to the gens to which it owed its existence.
But in practical life the gens was not of much avail; and
instead of it, exactly as we might expect, we find an artificial
union of familiae, a union of which the essential thing is
not the idea of kin, but that of the land occupied, and
known all over Italy by the word <i>pagus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> Before I go on
to describe the religion of the family, it is necessary to put
the familia into its proper relation with this territorial
union.</p>

<p>The pagus is the earliest Italian administrative unit of
which we know anything; a territory, of which the
essential feature was the boundary, not any central
point within the boundary. In all probability it was
originally the land on which a gens had settled, though
settlement produces changes, and the land of gens and
pagus was not identical in later times. But within this
boundary line, of which we shall hear something more
presently, how were the component parts, the familiae of
the gens, settled down on the land? Of the village community
so familiar to us in Teutonic countries, there
is no certain trace in Latium. <i>Vicus</i>, the only word
which might suggest it, is identical with the Greek &#959;&#7990;&#954;&#959;&#987;,
a house; later it is used for houses standing together, or
for a street in a town. But the vicus in the country has
left no trace of itself as a distinct administrative union
like our village community; the vico-magistri of the
Roman city were urban officers; and what is more important,
we know of no religious festivals of the vicus, like
those of the pagus, of which there are well-attested records.
The probability then is that the unit within the pagus
was not the village but the homestead, and that these
stood at a distance from each other, as they do in Celtic
countries, not united together in a village, and each housing
a family group working its own land and owning its
own cattle.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> The question of the amount and the tenure
of the land of this group is a very difficult one, into which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
it is not necessary to enter closely here. There can,
however, be no doubt that it possessed in its own right a
small piece of garden ground (<i>heredium</i>), and also an
allotment of land in the arable laid out by the settlers in
common&mdash;<i>centuriatus ager</i>; whether the ownership of this
was vested in the individual paterfamilias or in the gens
as a whole, does not greatly matter for our purposes.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>
Lastly, as it is certain that the familia owned cattle
and sheep, we may be sure that it enjoyed the right
of common pasture on the land not divided up for
tillage.</p>

<p>We see all this through a mist, and a mist that is not
likely ever to lift; but yet the outlines of the picture are
clear enough to give us the necessary basis for a study of
the religion of the familia. The religious points, if I may
use the expression&mdash;those points, that is, which are the
object of special anxiety (<i>religio</i>)&mdash;lie in the boundaries,
both of the pagus as a whole, and of the arable land of
the familia, in the house itself and its free inhabitants,
and in the family burying-place; and to these three may
no doubt be added the spring which supplied the household
with water. Boundaries, house, burying-place, spring,&mdash;all
these are in a special sense sacred, and need constant
and regular religious care.</p>

<p>Let us begin with the house, the central point of the
economic and religious unit. The earliest Italian house
was little more than a wigwam, more or less round, constructed
of upright posts connected with wattles, and with
a closed roof of straw or branches.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> This would seem to
have been the type of house of the immigrating people
who settled on the tops of hills and lived a pastoral life;
when they descended into the plains and became a settled
agricultural people, they adopted a more roomy and
convenient style of building, suitable for storing their
grain or other products, and for the maintenance of a
fire for cooking these. Whether the rectangular house,
with which alone we are here concerned, was developed
under Greek or Etruscan influence, or suggested independ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>ently
by motives of practical convenience, is matter of
dispute, and must be left to archaeologists to decide.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p>This is the house in which the Latin family lived
throughout historical times, the house which we know as
the sacred local habitation of divine and human beings.
It consisted in its simplest form, as we all know, of a
single room or hall, the atrium, with a roof open in the
middle and sloping inwards to let the rain fall into a
basin (<i>compluvium</i>). Here the life of the family went on,
and here was the hearth (<i>focus</i>), the "natural altar of the
dwelling-room of man,"<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> and the seat of Vesta, the spirit
of the fire, whose aid in the cooking of the food was
indispensable in the daily life of the settlers. This sacred
hearth was the centre of the family worship of later times,
until under Greek influence the arrangement of the
house was modified;<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> and we may be certain that it was
so in the simple farm life of early Latium. In front of it
was the table at which the family took their meals, and
on this was placed the salt-cellar (<i>salinum</i>), and the
sacred salt-cake, baked even in historical times in
primitive fashion by the daughters of the family, as in all
periods for the State by the Vestal virgins. After the
first and chief course of the mid-day meal, silence was
enjoined, and an offering of a part of the cake was thrown
on to the fire from a small sacrificial plate or dish
(<i>patella</i>).<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> This alone is enough to prove that Vesta, the
spirit of the fire, was the central point of the whole worship,
the spiritual embodiment of the physical welfare of
the family.</p>

<p>Behind the hearth, <i>i.e.</i> farther at the back of the <i>atrium</i>,
was the <i>penus</i>, or storing-place of the household. <i>Penus</i>
was explained by the learned Scaevola<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> as meaning anything
that can be eaten or drunk, but not so much that
which is each day set out on the table, as that which is
kept in store for daily consumption; it is therefore in
origin the food itself, though in later times it became also
the receptacle in which that food was stored. This store
was inhabited or guarded by spirits, the <i>di penates</i>, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
together with Vesta represent the material vitality of the
family; these spirits, always conceived and expressed in
the plural, form a group in a way which is characteristic
of the Latins, and their plurality is perhaps due to the
variety and frequent change of the material of the store.
The religious character of the store is also well shown by
the fact, if such it be, that no impure person was allowed
to meddle with it; the duty was especially that of the
children of the family,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> whose purity and religious
capability was symbolised throughout Roman history by
the purple-striped toga which they wore, and secured also
by the amulet, within its capsule the <i>bulla</i>, of which I
spoke in the last lecture.</p>

<p>Vesta and the Penates represent the spiritual side of
the material needs of the household; but there was
another divine inhabitant of the house, the Genius of the
paterfamilias, who was more immediately concerned with
the continuity of the family. Analogy with the worldwide
belief in the spiritual double of a man, his "other-soul,"
compels us to think of this Genius, who accompanied
the Latin from the cradle to the grave, as
originally a conception of this kind. The Latins had
indeed, in common with other races, what we may call
the breath-idea of the soul, as we see from the words
<i>animus</i> and <i>anima</i>, and also the shadow-idea, as is proved
by the word <i>umbra</i> for a departed spirit. But the Genius
was one of those guardian spirits, treated by Professor
Tylor as a different species of the same genus, which
accompany a man all his life and help him through its
many changes and chances;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> and the peculiarity of this
Latin guardian is that he was specially helpful in continuing
the life of the family. The soul of a man is often
conceived as the cause of life, but not often as the procreative
power itself; and that this latter was the Latin
idea is certain, both from the etymology of the word
and from the fact that the marriage-bed was called <i>lectus
genialis</i>. I am inclined to think that this peculiarity of
the Latin conception of Genius was the result of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
unusually strong idea that the Latins must have had,
even when they first passed into Italy, of kinship as
determined not by the mother but by the father.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> It is
possible, I think, that the Genius was a soul of later
origin than those I have just mentioned, and developed
in the period when the gens arose as the main group of
kinsmen real or imaginary. I would suggest that we
may see in it the connecting link between that group
and the individual adult males within it; in that case
the Genius would be that soul of a man which enables
him to fulfil the work of continuing the life of the gens.
We can easily imagine how it might eventually come to
be his guardian spirit, and to acquire all the other senses
with which we are familiar in Roman literature. With
the development of the idea of individuality, the individuality
of a man as apart from the kin group, the idea of
the individuality of the Genius also became emphasised,
until it became possible to think of it as even living on
after the death of its companion;<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> in this way, in course
of time, the Genius came to exercise a curious influence
on the idea of the Manes. The history of the idea of
Genius, and its application to places, cities, etc., is indeed
a curious one, and of no small interest in the study of
religion; but we must return to the primitive house and
its divine inhabitants. There is one more of these who
calls for a word before I pass to the land and the boundaries;
we meet him on the threshold as we leave the
dwelling.</p>

<p>It is, of course, well known to anthropologists that the
door of a house is a dangerous point, because evil spirits
or the ghosts of the dead may gain access to the house
through it. Among the innumerable customs which
attest this belief there are one or two Roman ones, <i>e.g.</i>
the practice of making a man, who has returned home
after his supposed death in a foreign country, enter the
house by the roof instead of the door; for the door must
be kept barred against ghosts, and this man may be after
all a ghost, or at least he may have evil spirits or miasma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
about him.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> It was at the doorway that a curious
ceremony took place (to which I shall ask your attention
again) immediately after the birth of a child, in order to
prevent Silvanus, who may stand for the dangerous
spirits of the forest, from entering in and vexing the
baby.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> Again, a dead man, as among so many other
peoples, was carried out of the doorway with his feet
foremost, so that he should not find his way back; and
the old Roman practice of burial by night probably had
the same object.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> Exactly the same anxiety (<i>religio</i>) is
seen in regard to the gates of a city; the wall was in
some sense holy (<i>sanctus</i>), but the gates, through which
was destined to pass much that might be dangerous,
could not be thus sanctified. Was there, then, no protecting
spirit of these doors and gates?</p>

<p>St. Augustine, writing with Varro before him, finds
no less than three spirits of the entrance to a house:
Forculus, of the door itself; Limentinus, of the threshold;
and Cardea, of the hinges of the door; and these Varro
seems to have found in the books of the pontifices.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> I
must postpone the question as to what these pontifical
books really represented; but the passage will at least
serve to show us the popular anxiety about the point of
entrance to a house, and its association with the spirit
world. Of late sober research has reached the conclusion
that the original door-spirit was Janus, whom we
know in Roman history as residing in the symbolic gate
of the Forum, and as the god of beginnings, the first
deity to be invoked in prayer, as Vesta was the last.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>
But Janus is also wanted for far higher purposes by
some eminent Cambridge scholars; they have their own
reasons for wanting him as a god of the sky, as a double
of Jupiter, as the mate of Diana, and a deity of the oak.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>
So, too, he was wanted by the philosophical speculators of
the last century b.c., who tried to interpret their own humble
deities in terms of Greek philosophy and Greek polytheism.
The poets too, who, as Augustine says, found Forculus
and his companions beneath their notice, played strange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
tricks with this hoary old god, as any one may read in the
first book of Ovid's <i>Fasti</i>. I myself believe that the
main features of the theology (if we may use the word) of
the earliest Rome were derived from the house and the
land as an economic and religious unit, and I am strongly
inclined to see in Janus bifrons of the Forum a developed
form of the spirit of the house-door; but the question is
a difficult one, and I shall return to it in a lecture on the
deities of early Rome.</p>

<p>So far I have said nothing of the Lar familiaris who
has become a household word as a household deity; and
yet we are on the point of leaving the house of the old
Latin settler to look for the spirits whom he worships on
his land. The reason is simply that after repeated examination
of the evidence available, I find myself forced
to believe that at the period of which I am speaking the
Lar was not one of the divine inhabitants of the house.
When Fustel de Coulanges wrote his brilliant book <i>La
Cit&eacute; antique</i>, which popularised the importance of the
worship of ancestors as a factor in Aryan civilisation, he
found in the Lar, who in historical times was a familiar
figure in the house, the reputed founder of the family; and
until lately this view has been undisputed. But if my
account of the relation of the family to the gens is correct,
the family would stand in no need of a reputed founder;
that symbol of the bond of kinship was to be found in the
gens of which the family was an offshoot, a cutting, as it
were, planted on the land. Still more convincing is the
fact that when we first meet with the Lar as an object of
worship he is not in the house but on the land. The
oldest Lar of whom we know anything was one of a
characteristic Roman group of which the individuals
lived in the <i>compita</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the spots where the land belonging
to various households met, and where there were
chapels with as many faces as there were properties,
each face containing an altar to a Lar,&mdash;the presiding
spirit of that allotment, or rather perhaps of the whole
of the land of the familia, including that on which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
house stood.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> Thus the Lar fills a place in the private
worship which would otherwise be vacant, that of the
holding and its productive power. In this sense, too, we
find the Lares in the hymn of the Arval Brethren, one of
the oldest fragments of Latin we possess; for the spirits
of the land would naturally be invoked in the lustration
of the <i>ager Romanus</i> by this ancient religious gild.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p>But how, it may be asked, did the Lar find his way
into the house, to become the characteristic deity of the
later Roman private worship there? I believe that he
gained admittance through the slaves of the familia, who
had no part in the worship of the dwelling, but were
admitted to the Compitalia, or yearly festival of which
the Lares of the compita were the central object. Cato
tells us that the vilicus, the head of the familia of slaves,
might not "facere rem divinam nisi Compitalibus in
compito aut in foco";<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> which I take to mean that he
might sacrifice for his fellow-slaves to the Lar at the
compitum, or to the Lar in the house, if the Lar were
already transferred from the compitum to the house. In
the constant absence of the owner, the paterfamilias of
Rome's stirring days, the worship of the Lar at the compitum
or in the house came to be more and more distinctly
the right of the vilicus and his wife as representing
the slaves, and thus too the Lar came to be called by the
epithet <i>familiaris</i>, which plainly indicates that in his cult
the slaves were included. And as it was the old custom
that the slaves should sit at the meals of the family on
benches below the free members (<i>subsellia</i>),<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> what more
natural than that they should claim to see there the Lar
whom alone of the deities of the farm they were permitted
to worship, and that they should bring the Lar
or his double from the compitum to the house, in the frequent
absence of the master?<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p>The festival of the Lar was celebrated at the compitum,
and known as Compitalia or Laralia; it took place
soon after the winter solstice, on a day fixed by the
paterfamilias, in concert, no doubt, with the other heads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
of families in the pagus. Like most rejoicings at this
time of year, it was free and jovial in character, and
the whole familia took part in it, both bond and free.
Each familia sacrificed on its own altar, which was placed
fifteen feet in front of the compitum, so that the worshippers
might be on their own land; but if, as we may
suppose, the whole pagus celebrated this rite on the same
day, there was in this festival, as in others to be mentioned
directly, a social value, a means of widening the
outlook of the familia and associating it with the needs of
others in its religious duties. This is the <i>religio Larium</i>
of which Cicero speaks in the second book of his <i>de
Legibus</i>, which was "posita in fundi villaeque conspectu,"
and handed down for the benefit both of masters and men
from remote antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>There were other festivals in which all the familiae of
a pagus took part. Of these we know little, and what
we do know is almost entirely due to the love of the
Augustan poets for the country and its life and customs;
"Fortunatus et ille deos qui novit agrestes," wrote Virgil,
contrasting himself with the philosopher poet whom he
revered. Varro, in his list of Roman festivals,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> just
mentions a festival called Sementivae, associated with
the sowing of the seed, and celebrated by all pagi, if we
interpret him rightly; but Ovid has given us a charming
picture of what must be this same rite, and places it
clearly in winter, after the autumn sowing<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Ovid may here be writing of his own home at Sulmo,
and what took place there in the Augustan age; but we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
may read his description into the life of old Latium, for
rustic life is tenacious of old custom, especially where the
economic conditions remain always the same. We may
do the same with another beautiful picture left us by
Tibullus, also a poet of the country, which I have recently
examined at length in the <i>Classical Review</i>.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> The
festival he describes has often been identified with Ovid's,
but I am rather disposed to see in it a lustratio of the
<i>ager paganus</i> in the spring, of the same kind as the
famous one in Virgil's first <i>Georgic</i>, to be mentioned
directly; for Tibullus, after describing the scene, which
he introduces with the words "fruges lustramus et agros,"
puts into perfect verse a prayer for the welfare of the
crops and flocks, and looks forward to a time when (if
the prayer succeeds) the land shall be full of corn, and
the peasant shall heap wood upon a bonfire&mdash;perhaps
one of the midsummer fires that still survive in the
Abruzzi. Virgil's lines are no less picturesque;<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> and
though he does not mention the pagus, he is clearly
thinking of a lustratio in which more than one familia
takes part&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">cuncta tibi Cererem pubes agrestis adoret.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is a spring festival "extremae sub casum hiemis, iam
vere sereno"; and I shall return to it when we come to
deal with the processional lustratio of the farm. Like
the descriptions of Ovid and Tibullus, it is more valuable
to us for the idea it gives us of the spirit of old Italian
agricultural religion than for exact knowledge about
dates and details. There was, of course, endless variety
in Italy in both these; and it is waste of time to try and
make the descriptions of the rural poets fit in with the
fixed festivals of the Roman city calendar.</p>

<p>Nor is it quite safe to argue back from that calendar
to the life of the familia and the pagus, except in general
terms. As we shall see, the calendar is based on the life
and work of an agricultural folk, and we may by all
means guess that its many agricultural rites existed before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>hand
in the earlier social life; but into detail we may not
venture. As Varro, however, has mentioned the Saturnalia
in the same sentence with the Compitalia, we may guess
that that famous jovial festival was a part of the rustic
winter rejoicing. And here, too, I may mention another
<i>festa</i> of that month, of which a glimpse is given us by
Horace, another country-loving poet, who specially mentions
the pagus as taking part in it. Faunus and Silvanus
were deities or spirits of the woodland among which these
pagi lay, and in which the farmers ran their cattle in the
summer;<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> by Horace's time Faunus had been more or
less tarred with a Greek brush, but in the beautiful little
ode I am alluding to he is still a deity of the Italian
farmer,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> who on the Nones of December besought him to
be gracious to the cattle now feeding peacefully on the
winter pasture:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i2">cum bove pagus.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is one more rite of familia or pagus, or both, of
which I must say a word before I return for a while
to the house and its inhabitants. One of the most important
matters for the pagus, as for the landholding
household, was the fixing of the boundaries of their land,
whether as against other pagi or households, or as
separating that land from unreclaimed forest. This was
of course, like all these other operations of the farm, a
matter of religious care and anxiety&mdash;a matter in which
the feeling of anxiety and awe (<i>religio</i>) brought with it, to
use an expression of Cicero's, both <i>cura</i> and <i>caerimonia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>
The <i>religio terminorum</i> is known to us in some detail, as it
existed in historical times, from the Roman writers on
<i>agrimetatio</i>; and with their help the whole subject has
been made intelligible by Rudorff in the second volume
of the <i>Gromatici</i>.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> We know that many different objects
might serve as boundary marks, according to the nature of
the land, especially trees and stones; and in the case of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
the latter, which would be the usual <i>termini</i> in agricultural
land at some distance from forest, we have the religious
character of the stone and its fixing most instructively
brought out. "Fruits of the earth, and the bones, ashes,
and blood of a victim were put into a hole in the ground
by the landholders whose lands converged at the point,
and the stone was rammed down on the top and carefully
fixed."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> This had the practical effect&mdash;for all Latin
religion has a practical side&mdash;of enabling the stone to be
identified in the future. But Ovid<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> gives us a picture of
the yearly commemorative rite of the same nature, from
which we see still better the force of the <i>religio terminorum</i>.
The boundary-stone is garlanded, and an altar is built;
the fire is carried from the hearth of the homestead by a
materfamilias, the priestess of the family; a young son of
the family holds a basket full of fruits of the earth, and a
little daughter shakes these into the fire and offers honey-cakes.
Others stand by with wine, or look on in silence,
clothed in white. The victims are lamb and sucking-pig,
and the stone is sprinkled with their blood, an act which
all the world over shows that an object is holy and
tenanted by a spirit.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> And the ceremony ends with a
feast and hymns in honour of holy Terminus, who in
Ovid's time in the rural districts, and long before on the
Capitolium of Rome, had risen from the spirit sanctifying
the stone to become a deity, closely connected with Jupiter
himself, and to give his name to a yearly city festival on
February 23.</p>

<p>These festivals on the land were, some of them at least,
scenes of revelry, accompanied with dancing and singing,
as the poets describe them, the faces of the peasants
painted red with minium,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> according to an old Italian
custom which survived in the case of the triumphator of
the glorious days of the City-state. But if we may now
return for a moment to the homestead, there were events
of great importance to the family which were celebrated
there in more serious and sober fashion, with rites that
were in part truly religious, yet not without some features<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
that show the prevailing anxiety, rooted in the age of
taboo, which we learnt to recognise under the word <i>religio</i>.
Marriage was a religious ceremony, for we can hardly
doubt that the patrician <i>confarreatio</i>, in which a cake made
of the anciently used grain called <i>far</i> was offered to Jupiter,
and perhaps partaken of sacramentally by bride and
bridegroom, was the oldest form of marriage, and had its
origin in an age before the State came into being. We
must remember that the house was a sacred place, with
religious duties carried on within it, and the abode of
household spirits; and when a bride from another family
or gens was to be brought into it, it was essential that such
introduction should be carried out in a manner that would
not disturb the happy relations of the human and divine
inhabitants of the house. It was essential, too, that the
children expected of her should be such as should be able
to discharge their duties in the household without hurting
the feelings of these spirits. Some of the quaint customs
of the <i>deductio</i> of later times strongly suggest an original
anxiety about matters of such vital interest; the torch,
carried by a boy whose parents were both living, was of
whitethorn (<i>Spina alba</i>), which was a powerful protective
against hostile magic, and about which there were curious
superstitions.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> Arrived at the house, the bride smeared
the doorposts with wolf's fat and oil, and wound fillets of
wool around them&mdash;so dangerous was the moment of
entrance, so sacred the doorway; and finally, she was
carried over the threshold, and then, and then only, was
received by her husband into communion of fire and water,
symbolic of her acceptance as materfamilias both by man
and deity.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<p>When the new materfamilias presented her husband
with a child, there was another perilous moment; the
infant, if accepted by the father (<i>sublatus</i>, <i>i.e.</i> raised from
the earth on which it had been placed),<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> did not immediately
become a member of the family in the religious
sense, and was liable to be vexed by evil or mischievous
spirits from the wild woodland, or, as they phrased it in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
later days, by Silvanus. I have already alluded to the
curious bit of mummery which was meant to keep them
off. Three men at night came to the threshold and struck
it with an axe, a pestle, and a besom, so that "by these
signs of agriculture Silvanus might be prevented from
entering." The hostile spirits were thus denied entrance
to a dwelling in which friendly spirits of household life and
of settled agricultural pursuits had taken up their abode.
Nothing can better show the anxiety of life in those
primitive times, especially in a country like Italy, full of
forest and mountain, where dwelt mischievous Brownies
who would tease the settler if they could. But on the ninth
day after the birth (or the eighth in the case of a girl)
the child was "purified" and adopted into the family and
its sacra, and into the gens to which the family belonged,
and received its name&mdash;the latter a matter of more importance
than we can easily realise.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> From this time till
it arrived at the age of puberty it was protected by amulet
and <i>praetexta</i>; the tender age of childhood being then
passed, and youth and maiden endued with new powers,
the peculiar defensive armour of childhood might be dispensed
with.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></p>

<p>Lastly, the death of a member of the family was an
occasion of extreme anxiety, which might, however, be
allayed by the exact performance of certain rites (<i>iusta
facere</i>). The funeral ceremonies of the City-state were of
a complicated character, and the details are not all
of them easy to interpret. But the principle must
have been always the same&mdash;that the dead would "walk"
unless they had been deposited with due ceremony in the
bosom of Mother Earth, and that their natural tendency
in "walking" was to find their way back to the house
which had been their home in life. Whether buried or
burnt, the idea was the same: if burnt, as seems to have
been common Roman practice from very early times,
at least one bone had to be buried as representing the
whole body. We have seen that certain precautions were
taken to prevent the dead man from finding his way back,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
such as carrying him out of the house feet foremost; and
if he were properly buried and the house duly purified
afterwards, the process of prevention was fairly complete.
His ghost, shade, or double then passed beneath the earth
to join the whole body of Manes in the underworld,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> and
could only return at certain fixed times&mdash;such at least
was the idea expressed in the customs of later ages. But
if a paterfamilias or his representative had omitted <i>iusta
facere</i>, or if the dead man had never been buried at all,
carried off by an enemy or some wild beast, he could
never have descended to that underworld, and was roaming
the earth disconsolately, and with an evil will. The
primitive idea of anxiety is well expressed in the Roman
festival of the Lemuria in May, when the head of a household
could get rid of the ghosts by spitting out black
beans<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> from his mouth and saying, "With these I redeem
me and mine." Nine times he says this without looking
round: then come the ghosts behind him and gather up
the beans unseen. After other quaint performances he
nine times repeats the formula, "Manes exite paterni,"
then at last looks round, and the ghosts are gone.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> This
is plainly a survival from the private life of the primitive
household, and well illustrates its fears and anxieties; but
the State provided, as we shall see, another and more
religious ceremony, put limitations on the mischievous
freedom of the ghosts, and ordained the means of expiation
for those who had made a slip in the funeral ceremonies,
or whose dead had been buried at sea or had died in a far
country.</p>

<p>I have thus tried to sketch the life of the early Latin
family in its relations with the various manifestations of
the Power in the universe. We have seen enough, I
think, to conclude that it had a strong desire to be in
right relations with that Power, and to understand its
will; but we may doubt whether that desire had as yet
become very effective. The circumstances of the life of
the Latin farmer were hardly such as to rid him of much
of the <i>religio</i> that he had inherited from his wilder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
ancestors, or had found springing up afresh within him as
he contended with the soil, the elements, and the hostile
beings surrounding him, animal, human, and spiritual. He
is living in an age of transition; he is half-way between
the age of magic and a new age of religion and duty.</p>

viii. Dr. Frazer finds traces of Mutterrecht only in the succession
to the kingship of Alba and Rome, of which the evidence is of course
purely legendary. If the legends represent fact in any sense, they
point, if I understand him rightly, to a kingship held by a non-Latin
race, or, as he calls it, plebeian. Binder, <i>Die Plebs</i>, p. 403 foll.,
believes that the original Latin population, <i>i.e.</i> the plebs of later
times, lived under Mutterrecht.</p></div>

in <i>Dict. of Antiquities</i>, <i>s.v.</i> "Agrimetatio," p. 85. The view that there
was freehold garden land attached to the homestead gains strength
from a statement of Pliny (<i>N.H.</i> xix. 50) that the word used in the
XII. Tables for villa, which was the word in classical times for
the homestead, was <i>hortus</i>, a garden, and that this was <i>heredium</i>,
private property. See Mommsen, <i>Staatsrecht</i>, iii. 23. It would
indeed be strange if the house had no land immediately attached
to it; we know that in the Anglo-Saxon village community
the villani, bordarii and cotagii, had their garden croft attached to
their dwellings, apart from such strips as they might hold from the
lord of the manor in the open fields. See Vinogradoff, <i>Villainage
in England</i>, p. 148. For the <i>centuriatus ager</i>, Roby <i>l.c.</i> We have
no direct knowledge of the system in the earliest times, but it is
almost certain that it was old-Italian in outline, and not introduced
by the Etruscans, as stated, <i>e.g.</i>, by Deecke-M&uuml;ller, <i>Etrusker</i>, ii. 128.</p></div>

unable to agree with Wissowa in his view of Faunus (<i>R.K.</i> p. 172 foll.).
I may here mention a passage of the gromatic writer Dolabella
(<i>Gromatici</i>, i. 302), in which he says that there were three Silvani
to each <i>possessio</i> or large estate of later times: "S. domesticus,
possessioni consecratus: alter agrestis, pastoribus consecratus: tertius
orientalis, cui est in confinio lucus positus, a quo inter duo pluresque
fines oriuntur." Faunus never became domesticated, but he belongs
to the same type as Silvanus. Von Domaszewski, in his recently
published <i>Abhandlungen zur r&ouml;m. Religion</i>, p. 61, discredits the
passage about the three Silvani, following a paper of Mommsen.
But his whole interesting discussion of Silvanus shows well how
many different forms that curious semi-deity could take.</p></div>

the doorposts from modern Europe will be found collected in
Samter, <i>Familienfeste</i>, p. 81 foll. The authority for the wolf's fat
was Masurius Sabinus, quoted by Pliny, <i>N.H.</i> xxviii. 142 (cp. 157),
who adds from the same author, "ideo novas nuptas illo perungere
postes solitas, ne quid mali medicamenti inferretur." The real
reason was, no doubt, that it was a charm against evil <i>spirits</i>, not
against poison; but it is worth while to quote here another passage
of Pliny (xx. 101), where he says that a squill hung <i>in limine
ianuae</i> had the same power, according to Pythagoras. Some may
see a reminiscence of totemism in the wolf's fat: in any case the

authorities. For the importance of the name among wild and semi-civilised
peoples, Frazer, <i>G.B.</i> i. 403 foll.; Tylor, <i>Primitive Culture</i>,
ii. 430 foll. All these ceremonies of birth, naming, and initiation
(puberty) have recently been included by M. van Gennep in what
he calls <i>Rites de passage</i> (see his book with that title, which
appeared after these lectures were prepared, especially chapters v.
and vi.). In all these ceremonies he traces more or less successfully
a sequence of rites of separation (<i>i.e.</i> from a previous condition),
of margin, where the ground is, so to speak, neutral, and of
"aggregation," when the subject is introduced to a new state or
condition of existence. If I understand him rightly, he looks on
this as the proper and primitive explanation of all such rites, and
denies that they need to be accounted for animistically, <i>i.e.</i> by
assuming that riddance of evil spirits, or purification of any kind,
is the leading idea in them. They are, in fact, quasi-dramatic
celebrations of a process of going over from one status to another,
and may be found in connection with all the experiences of man in
a social state. But the Roman society, of which I am describing
the religious aspect, had beyond doubt reached the animistic stage
of thought, and was in process of developing it into the theological
stage; hence these ceremonies are marked by sacrifices, as marriage,
the <i>dies lustricus</i> (see De Marchi, p. 169, and Tertull. <i>de Idol.</i> 16)
most probably, and puberty (<i>R.F.</i> p. 56). I do not fully understand
how far van Gennep considers sacrifice as marking a later stage in
the development of the ideas of a society on these matters (see his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
note in criticism of Oldenburg, p. 78); but I see no good reason
to abandon the words purification and lustration, believing that
even if he is right in his explanation of the original performances,
these ideas had been in course of time engrafted on them.</p></div>

throw grave doubt on some of the most important conclusions of
Rohde's <i>Psyche</i>, the work which most writers on the ideas of the
Greeks and Romans have been content to follow. Mr. Lawson
seems to me to have proved that the object of both burial and
cremation (which in both peninsulas are found together) was to
secure dissolution for the substance of the body, so that the soul
might not be able to inhabit the body again, and the two together
return to annoy the living (see especially chapters v. and vi.). But
his answer to the inevitable question, why in that case sustenance
should be offered to the dead at the grave, is less satisfactory
(see pp. 531, 538), and I do not at present see how to co-ordinate
it with Roman usage. But I find hardly a trace of the belief that
the dead had to be placated like the gods by sacrifice and prayer,
except in <i>Aen.</i> iii. 63 foll. and v. 73 foll. In the first of these
passages Polydorus had not been properly buried, as Servius
observes <i>ad loc.</i> to explain the nature of the offerings; the second
presents far more difficulties than have as yet been fairly faced.</p></div>

<h4>LECTURE V</h4>

<h5>THE CALENDAR OF NUMA</h5>


<p>The religion of the household had two main characteristics.
First, it was a perfectly natural and organic growth,
the result of the Roman farmer's effective desire to put
himself and his in right relations with the spiritual powers
at work for good or ill around him. His conception of
these powers I shall deal with more fully in the next
lecture; but I have said enough to prove that it was not
a degrading one. The spirits of his house and his land
and his own Genius were friendly powers, all of them of
the greatest importance for his life and his work, and their
claims were attended to with regularity and devotion.
From Vesta and the Penates, the Lar, the Genius, the
Manes, and the spirits of the doorway and the spring,
there was nothing to fear if they were carefully propitiated;
and as his daily life and comfort depended on this
propitiation, they were really divine members of the
<i>familia</i>, and might become, and perhaps did become, the
objects of real affection as well as worship. In this well-regulated
practical life of the early agricultural settlers,
with its careful attention to the claims of its divine
protectors, we may perhaps see the germs of a real religious
expression of human life.</p>

<p>Secondly, there was doubtless at the same time
constant cause for anxiety. Beyond the house and the
land there were unreclaimed spirits of the woodland
which might force an entrance into the sacred limits
of the house; the ghosts of the dead members were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
constantly wishing to return; the crops might be attacked
by strange diseases, by storms or drought, and man himself
was liable to seasonal disease or sudden pestilence. The
cattle and sheep might stray into the remote forest and
become the prey of evil beasts, if not of evil spirits. How
was the farmer to meet all these troubles, caused, as he
supposed, by spirits whose ways he did not understand?
How were they to be propitiated as they themselves would
wish? How were the omens to be interpreted from which
their will might be guessed? How were the proper times
and seasons for each religious operation to be discovered?
If my imagination is not at fault, I seem to see that the
Latin farmer must have had to shift for himself in most
of his dealings with the supernatural powers about him;
<i>religio</i>, the sense of awe and of dependence, must have
been constantly with him. But even here we may see, I
think, a possible germ of religious development; for without
this feeling of awe religious forms tend to become
meaningless: lull <i>religio</i> to sleep, and the forms cease to
represent effectively man's experience of life. We have
to see later on how this paralysis of the religious instinct
did actually take place in early Roman history.</p>

<p>For we now have to leave the religion of the household,
and to study that of the earliest form of the City-state.
We have enjoyed a glint of light reflected from later
times on the religion of the early Roman family, and are
about to enjoy another glint&mdash;nay, a gleam of real light,
and not merely a reflected one&mdash;which the earliest
religious document we possess casts on the religion of the
City-state of Rome. Between the two there is a long
period of almost complete darkness. We know hardly
anything as yet, and it is not likely that we shall ever
know anything definite, about the stages of development
which must have been passed before Rome became the
so-called city of the Four Regions, when her history may
be said really to begin. The pagus hardly helps us here;
it was not an essential advance on the family, and its
religion was comprehensive, not intensive. Each pagus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
however, seems to have had within its bounds an <i>oppidum</i>,
or stronghold on a hill; and such oppida were the seven
<i>montes</i> of early Rome, which, with the pagi belonging to
them, survived in name to the end of the Republic, with
some kind of a religious festival uniting them together,
about which we have hardly any knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> This looks
like a stage in the process of change from farm to city,
and it has generally been believed to mark one. Unfortunately
nothing to our purpose can be founded on it.
We must be content with the undoubted fact that about
the eighth or seventh century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the site of Rome was
occupied and strengthened as a bulwark against the
Etruscan people who were pressing down from the north
upon the valley of the Tiber;<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> we may take it that the
old central fortress of Latium, on the Alban hill, was not
in the right position for defence, and that it was seen to
be absolutely necessary to make a stronghold of the
position offered by the hills which abut on the river twenty
miles above its mouth&mdash;the only real position of defence
for the Latin settlements in its rear. Here an <i>urbs</i> was
made with <i>murus</i> and <i>pomoerium</i>, <i>i.e.</i> material and spiritual
boundaries, taking in a space sufficient to hold the
threatened rural population with their flocks and herds,
with the river in the front and a common citadel on the
Capitoline hill, and including the Palatine, Quirinal,
Esquiline, Caelian and Aventine hills, though the last
named remained technically outside the pomoerium.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></p>

<p>It is to this city that our earliest religious document,
the so-called Calendar of Numa, belongs. That calendar
includes the cult of Quirinus on the hill which still bears
his name, and that hill was an integral part of the city as
just described. On the other hand, it tells us nothing of
the great cult of the <i>trias</i> on the Capitoline&mdash;Jupiter,
Juno, Minerva&mdash;which by universal tradition was instituted
much later by the second Tarquinius, <i>i.e.</i> under an Etruscan
dynasty; nor does Diana appear in it, the goddess who
was brought from Latium and settled on the Aventine
before the end of the kingly period. We have, then, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
<i>terminus ex quo</i> for the date of the calendar in the inclusion
in the city of the Quirinal hill, and a <i>terminus
ad quem</i> in the foundation of the Diana temple on the
Aventine.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> We cannot date these events precisely; but
it is sufficient for our purpose if it be taken as proved
that the Fasti belong to the fully developed city, and yet
were drawn up before that conquest by the Etruscans
which we may regard as a certainty, and which is
marked by the foundations of Etruscan masonry which
served to support the great Capitoline temple. And this
is also borne out by the undoubted fact that the calendar
itself shows no trace of Etruscan influence. But I must
now go on to explain exactly what this calendar is.</p>

<p>The <i>Fasti anni Romani</i> exist chiefly on stone as inscriptions,
and date from the Early Empire, between 31 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> and
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 51. They give us, in fact, the calendar as revised by
Caesar; but no one now doubts that Mommsen was right in
detecting in these inscriptions the skeleton of the original
calendar which the Romans ascribed to Numa.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> This is
distinguished from later additions by the large capital
letters in which it is written or inscribed in all the fragments
we possess; it gives us the days of the month with
their religious characteristics as affecting state business,
the names of the religious festivals which concern the
whole state, and the Kalends, Nones, and Ides in each
month. Excluding these last, we have the names, in a
shortened form, of forty-five festivals; and these festivals,
thus placed by an absolutely certain record in their right
place in each month and in the year, must be the foundation
of all scientific study of the religious practice of the
Roman state, taken together with certain additions in
smaller capitals, and with such information about them as
we can obtain from literary sources.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p>The smaller capitals give us such entries as <i>feriae
Iovi</i>, <i>feriae Saturno</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the name of a deity to whom
a festival was sacred, the foundation days of temples,
generally with the name of the deity in the dative and
the position of the temple in the city, and certain <i>ludi</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
and memorial days, which belong to a much later age
than the original festivals. But the names of those
which are inscribed in large letters bear witness beyond all
question to their own antiquity; for among them there is
not one which has anything to do, so far as we know, with
a non-Roman deity, and we know that foreign deities
began to arrive in Rome before the end of the kingly
period. Here, then, we have genuine information about
the oldest religious doings of the City-state, in what
indeed is, as Mommsen said, the most ancient source of
our knowledge about Roman antiquity generally.</p>

<p>The first point we notice in studying this calendar
(putting aside for the present the question as to the
agency by which it was drawn up) is this: it exactly
reflects a transition from the life of a rural population
engaged in agriculture, to the highly-organised political
and military life of a City-state. In other words, the
State, whose religious needs and experience it reflects,
was one whose economic basis was agriculture, whose
life included legal and political business, and whose
activity in the season of arms was war.</p>

<p>This last characteristic is discernible chiefly, if not
entirely, in the months of March and October; and the
former of these bears the name of the great deity, who,
whatever may have been his origin or the earliest conception
of him, was throughout Roman history the god of
war. All through March up to the 23rd the Salii, the warlike
priests of Mars, were active, dancing and singing those
hymns of which an obscure fragment has come down to
us, and clashing and brandishing the sacred spears and
shields of the god (<i>ancilia</i>).<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> On the 19th these ancilia
were lustrated&mdash;a process to which I shall recur in
another lecture; and on the 23rd we find in the
calendar the festival Tubilustrium, which suggests the
lustration of the trumpets of the host before it took the
field. On the 14th of March,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> and also on the 27th of
February, we find Equirria in the calendar, which must be
understood as lustrations of the horses of the host, accom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>panied
with races. If we may take the ancilia as symbolising
the arms of the host, we see in the festivals of this
month a complete religious process preparing the material
of war for the perils inevitably to be met with beyond
the <i>ager Romanus</i>, whether from human or spiritual
enemies; and that the warriors themselves were subjected
to a process of the same kind we know from the
historical evidence of later times.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> Now in October,
when the season of arms was over, we find indications
of a parallel process, which Wissowa was the first to
point out clearly, but without fully recognising its
religious import.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> It was not so much thanksgiving
(<i>Dankfest</i>) after a campaign that was necessary on the
return of the army, as purification (or disinfection) from
the taint of bloodshed, and from contact with strange
beings human and spiritual.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> On October 15, the Ides,
there was a horse-race in the Campus Martius, with a
sacrifice of the winning horse to Mars with peculiar
primitive ritual; this, however, for some reason which I
shall presently try to discover, was not embodied in the
calendar under any special name. On the 19th, however,
we find the entry <span class="smcap">Armilustrium</span>, which tells its own tale.
The Salii, too, were active again in these days of October,
and on the day of the Armilustrium, as it would seem,
put their shields away (<i>condere</i>) in their <i>sacrarium</i>
until the March following. As Wissowa says, the ritual
of the Salii is thus a symbolic copy of the procedure of
war.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> From these indications in the calendar, helped
out by information drawn from the later entries and from
literary evidence, we see quite plainly that we are dealing
with the religion of a state which for half the year is
liable to be engaged in war. Rome was, in fact, a frontier
fortress on the Tiber against Etruscan enemies; she is
destined henceforward to be continually in arms, and she
has already expressed this great fact in her religious
calendar.</p>

<p>The legal and political significance of the calendar consists
in the division of the days of the year into two great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
groups, <i>dies fasti</i> and <i>nefasti</i>: the former are those on
which it is <i>fas</i>, <i>i.e.</i> religiously permissible, to transact civil
business, the latter those on which it would be <i>nefas</i> to
do so, <i>i.e.</i> sacrilege, because they are given over to the
gods. We need not, indeed, assume that these marks F
and N descend in every case from the very earliest times
into the pre-Julian calendar, or that the few days which
have other marks stood originally as we find them;
but of the primitive character of the main division we
can have no doubt. In the calendar as we have it 109
days belong to the divine, 235 to the human inhabitants
of the city. All but two of the former are days of odd
numbers in the month, and it is reasonable to suppose
that these two exceptions were later alterations. The
belief that odd numbers are lucky is a very widely-spread
superstition, and we do not need to have recourse to
Pythagoras to explain it; in this rule, as in others, <i>e.g.</i>
their taboo on eating beans, the Pythagoreans were only
following a native prejudice of southern Italy. "The
idea of luck in odd numbers," says Mr. Crooke,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> writing
of the Hindus, "is universal." Thus the simpler odd
numbers, three, five, seven, and nine, all recur constantly
in folklore; and the result is visible in this calendar.
Where a festival occupies more than one day in a
month, there is an interval between the two of one or
three days, making the whole number three or five.
Thus Carmentalia occur on 11th and 15th January, and
the Lemuria in May are on the 9th, 11th, and 13th; the
Lucaria in July on 19th and 21st. In some months, too,
<i>e.g.</i> August and December, perhaps also July and
February, there seem to be traces of an arrangement
by which festivals which probably had some connection
with each other are thus arranged; <i>e.g.</i> in August six
festivals, all concerned in some way with the fruits of
the earth and the harvest, occur on the 17th, 19th, 21st,
23rd, 25th, and 27th. It has recently been suggested<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a>
that these are arranged round one central festival, which
gives a kind of colouring to the others, as the Volcanalia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
in August, the Saturnalia in December. But the reasons
von Domaszewski gives for the arrangement, and the
further speculation that where it does not occur we may
find traces of an older system, as yet unaffected by the
so-called Pythagorean prejudice, do not seem to me
satisfactory. We may be content with the general
principle as I have stated it, and note that while religious
duties <i>must</i> be performed on days of odd number, civil
duties were not so restricted: the days belonging to the
gods, which were, so to speak, taboo days, were more
important than those belonging to men. There are, as
I have said, but two days marked in the large letters
as festivals, which are on days of even number, 24th
February and 14th March, the Regifugium and the
second Equirria; and about these we know so little that
it is almost useless to speculate as to the reason for their
exception from the rule. Two others, 24th March and
24th May, were partly the property of the gods and
partly of men, and are marked QRCF (<i>quando rex
comitiavit fas</i>); but the sense in which they partially
belonged to the gods is not the same as in the case of
sacrificial festivals.</p>

<p>This calendar thus shows obvious signs of both military
and political development; in other words, its witness to
the religious experience of the Romans proves that they
had successfully adjusted the forms and seasons of their
worship to the processes of government at home and of
military service in the field. But the most conspicuous
feature in it is the testimony it bears to the agricultural
habits of the people&mdash;to the fact that agriculture and not
trade, of which there is hardly a trace, was the economic
basis of their life. At the time when it was drawn up,
the Romans must have been able to subsist upon the
<i>ager Romanus</i>, though, as we shall see later on, it was
probably not long before they began commercial relations
with other peoples; for their food, which was almost
entirely vegetarian, and their clothing, which was entirely
of wool and leather,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> they depended on their crops,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
flocks, and herds; and the perils to which these were
liable remain for the State, as for the farming household,
the main subject of the propitiation of the gods, the main
object of their endeavours to keep themselves in right
relation with the Power manifest in the universe.</p>

<p>We can trace the series of agricultural operations in
the calendar without much difficulty all through the year.
The Roman year, we must remember, began with March,
and March, as we have seen, had under the military
necessities of the State become peculiarly appropriated
to the religious preparation of the burgher host for warlike
activity. But the festivals of April, when crops
were growing, cattle bringing forth young or seeking
summer pasture, all have direct reference to the work of
agriculture.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> At the Fordicidia, on the 15th, pregnant
cows were sacrificed to the Earth-goddess, and their
unborn calves burnt, apparently with the object of procuring
the fertility of the corn; and the Cerealia on the
19th, to judge by the name, must have had an object of
the same kind, though the supersession of Ceres by the
Greek Demeter had obscured this in historical times.
The Parilia on the 19th, recently illuminated by Dr.
Frazer,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> was a lustration of the cattle and sheep before
they left their winter pasture to encounter the dangers of
wilder hill or woodland, and may be compared with the
lustratio of the host before a campaign. On the 23rd the
Vinalia tells its own tale, and shows that the cultivation
of the vine was already a part of the agricultural work.
On the 25th the spirit of the red mildew, Robigus, was
the object of propitiation, at the time when the ear was
beginning to be formed in the corn, and was particularly
liable to attack from this pest.</p>

<p>The religious precautions thus taken in April were not
renewed in May; but at the end of that month of ripening
the whole of the <i>ager Romanus</i> was lustrated by the
Fratres Arvales. This important rite, for some reason
which we cannot be sure of, was a movable feast, left to
the discretion of the brethren, and therefore does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
appear in the calendar. In June the sacred character of
the new crops, now approaching their harvest, becomes
apparent; the <i>penus Vestae</i>, the symbolic receptacle of the
grain-store of the State, after remaining open from the 7th
to the 15th, was closed on that day for the rest of the
year, after being carefully cleansed: the refuse was religiously
deposited in a particular spot. Thus all was
made ready for the reception of the new grain, which, as
is now well known, has a sacred character among primitive
peoples, and must be stored and eaten with precaution.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a>
This was the chief religious work of June; in July, the
month when the harvest was actually going on, the
festivals are too obscure to delay us; they seem to have
some reference to water, rain, storms, but it is not clear
to me whether the object was to avert stormy weather
during the cutting of the crops, or, on the other hand, to
avert a drought in the hottest time of the year. The
true harvest festivals begin in August; the Consualia on
21st and Opiconsiva on 25th both seem to suggest the
operation of storing up (<i>condere</i>) the grain, and between
them we find the Volcanalia, of which the object was
perhaps to propitiate the fire-spirit at a time when the
heat of the sun might be dangerous to the freshly-gathered
crops.</p>

<p>After the crops were once harvested, ploughing and
sowing chiefly occupied the farming community until
December; and as these operations were not accompanied
by the same perils which beset the agriculturist in spring
and summer, they have left no trace in the calendar.
Special religious action was not necessary on their behalf.
It is not till the autumn sowing was over, and the workers
could rest from their labours, that we find another set of
festivals, of which the centre-point is the Saturnalia on the
17th, Saturnus being the deity, I think, both of the operation
of sowing and of the sown seed, now reposing in the
bosom of mother earth.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> A second Consualia on the
15th, and the Opalia on the 19th, like the corresponding
August festivals, seem to be concerned with the housed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
grain harvested in the previous August; I am disposed
to think that in all three we should see not only the
natural rejoicing after the labours of the autumn, but the
opening of the granaries and, perhaps, the first eating of
the grain. For on the Saturnalia there was a sacrifice at
Saturnus' altar, followed by a feast, which was afterwards
Graecised, but doubtless originally represented the primitive
feasting of the farm, in which the whole familia took
part. This brings us practically to the end of the agricultural
year as represented in the calendar; for spring
sowing was exceptional, the joyful feasts of pagus and
compitum are not to be found in our document, and the
month of February is specially occupied with the care
and cult of the dead (<i>Manes</i>).</p>

<p>At this point I wish to notice one or two results of
the adoption of a religious calendar such as I have been
describing, which are more to the purpose of these lectures
than some of the details I have had to point out. First,
let us remember that agricultural operations necessarily
vary in date according to the season, and that most of
the rural festivals of ancient Italy were not fixed to a
particular day, but were <i>feriae conceptivae</i>, settled perhaps
according to the decision of some meeting of heads of
families or officers of a pagus. That this was so we may
conjecture from the fact that those which survived into
historical times, <i>e.g.</i> Compitalia and Paganalia, and were
celebrated in the city, though not as <i>sacra pro populo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a>
were of varying date. But all the festivals of the calendar
were necessarily fixed, and the days on which they were
held were made over to the gods. Now by being thus
fixed they would soon begin to get out of relation to
agricultural life; just as, if the harvest festivals of our
churches were fixed to one day throughout the country,
the meaning of the religious service would sooner or later
begin to lose something of its force. And how much the
more would this be so if the calendar itself, from ignorance
or mismanagement, began to get out of relation with
the true season, as in course of time was frequently the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
case? When once under such circumstances the meaning
of a religious rite is lost, where is its psychological efficacy?
In the life of the old Latin farmer, as we saw, his religion
was a reality, an organic growth, coincident at every point
with the perils he encountered in his daily toil; here, in
the City-state, it must from the beginning have had a
tendency to become an unreality, and it ended by becoming
one entirely. Some of the old rites may have attached
new meanings to themselves; it is possible, for example,
that beneath the military rites of March there was an
original agricultural significance; the Saturnalia became
a merry mid-winter festival for a town population. But
a great number wholly lost meaning, and were so forgotten
or neglected in course of time that even learned
men like Varro do not seem to have been able to explain
them. The only practical question about them for the
later Romans was whether their days were <i>dies fasti</i> or
<i>nefasti</i> or <i>comitiales</i>,&mdash;what work might or might not be
done on them.</p>

<p>Another point, closely connected with the last, and
tending in the same direction, is that such a calendar as
this implies rigidity and routine in religious duties. A
well-ordered city life under a strong government must, of
course, be subject to routine; law, religious or civil, written
or unwritten, forces the individual into certain stereotyped
ways of life, subjects him to a certain amount of
wholesome discipline. The value of such routine to an
undisciplined people has been well pointed out by Bishop
Stubbs, in writing of the effect of the rule of the Norman
and Angevin kings on the English people,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> where it was
also a religious as well as a legal discipline that was at
work. In neither case was it the ignorant and superstitious
routine of savage life, which of late years we have
had to substitute for old fancies about the freedom of the
savage; it is the willing obedience of civilised man for
his own benefit. But if it means a routine of religious
rites which are beginning to lose their meaning; if the
relation between them and man's life and work is lost;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
and lastly, if, as was probably the case, the Fasti were
not published, but remained in the hands of a priesthood
or an aristocracy,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a>&mdash;then there is serious loss as well as
gain. You begin sooner or later to cease to feel your
dependence on the divine beings around you for your
daily bread, to get out of right relation with the Power
manifesting itself in the universe.</p>

<p>But, in the third place, we must believe that at first,
and indeed perhaps for ages, this very routine had an
important psychological result in producing increased comfort,
convenience, and confidence in the Roman's relations
with the divine inhabitants of his city. A certain number
of deities have taken up their abode within the walls of
the city, and are as much its inhabitants, its citizens, as
the human beings who live there; and all the relations
between the divine and human citizens are regulated now
by law, by a <i>ius divinum</i>, of which the calendar is a very
important part. <i>Religio</i>, the old feeling of doubt and
scruple, arising from want of knowledge in the individual,
is still there; it is, in fact, the feeling which has given rise
to all this organisation and routine, the <i>cura</i> and <i>caerimonia</i>,
as Cicero phrases it. But it must be already
losing its strength, its life; it was, so to speak, a constitutional
weakness, and the <i>ius divinum</i> is already
beginning to act on it as a tonic. Doubt has passed
into fixed usage, tradition has given place to organisation.
Time, place, procedure in all religious matters, are guaranteed
by those skilled in the <i>ius divinum</i>; they know
what to do as the festival of each deity comes round, and
at the right time and place they do it with scrupulous
attention to every detail. Thus the organisation of which
the calendar is our best example would have as its first
result the destruction of fear and doubt in the mind of
the ordinary Roman; it would tend to kill, or at least
to put to sleep, the <i>religio</i> which was the original motive
cause of this very organisation. As the State in our own
day has a tendency to relieve families of such duties as
the care and education of children, so the State at Rome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
relieved the family of constant anxiety about matters in
which they were ever in danger from the spirit-world.
The State and its authorities have taken the whole responsibility
of adjusting the relations of the human and
divine citizens.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p>Entirely in keeping with this psychological result of
the calendar is the fact, to which I have already alluded,
that it supplies us with hardly any evidence of the existence
of magic, or of those "beastly devices of the heathen"
which may roughly be included under that word; to use
the language of Mr. Lang, we find none of those "distressing
vestiges of savagery and barbarism which meet us in
the society of ancient Greece." It is true enough that we
do not know much about what was done at the various
festivals of the calendar, but what we do know, with one
or two exceptions, suggests an idea of worship as clean
and rational as that of the Homeric poems, which stands
in such striking contrast to that reflected in later Greek
literature.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> When we do read of any kind of grossness
in worship or the accompanying festivities, it is almost
always in the case of some rite which is <i>not</i> among those
in the Fasti. Such was the old festival of Anna Perenna
in March, where the plebs in Ovid's time spent the day
in revelry and drinking, and prayed for as many years of
life as they could drink cups of wine. Such again was
that of the October horse, when after a chariot-race in
the Campus the near horse of the winning team was
sacrificed, and his tail carried in hot haste to the Regia,
where the blood was allowed to drip on the sacred
hearth; while the head was the object of a fight between
the men of the Via Sacra and those of the Subura.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> We
may perhaps include in the list the ritual of the Argei, if
it was indeed, as I believe, of great antiquity;<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> on May
15, as we have seen, twenty-seven puppets of reeds or
straw were thrown into the Tiber from the <i>pons sublicius</i>,
possibly with the object of procuring rain for the growing
crops. Let us also note that <i>dies religiosi</i> were not
marked in the Fasti, <i>i.e.</i> days on which some uncomfort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>able
feeling prevailed, such as the three days on which
the <i>mundus</i> was open to allow the Manes to come up
from their shadowy abode below the earth; with the
character of such days as "uncanny" the calendar has
simply nothing to do. It is a document of religious law,
not of <i>superstitio</i>, a word which in Roman usage almost
invariably means what is outside that religious law, outside
the <i>ius divinum</i>; and it is a document of <i>religio</i>
only so far as it is meant to organise and carry out the
<i>cura</i> and <i>caerimonia</i>, the natural results of that feeling
which the Romans called <i>religio</i>. It stands on exactly
the same footing as the Law of the Israelites, which
supplied them in full detail with the <i>cura</i> and <i>caerimonia</i>,
and rigidly excluded all foreign and barbarous rites and
superstitions.</p>

<p>I do not, of course, mean to say that the State did
not recognise or allow the festivals which are not marked
in the calendar; the pontifices and Vestals were present
at the ceremony of the Argei, and the Regia was the
scene of a part of that of the October horse. But those
who drew up the calendar as the fundamental charter
of the <i>ius divinum</i> must have had their reasons for the
selection of forty-five days as made over to the deities
who were specially concerned with the State's welfare.
And on these days, so far as we know, there was a
regular ordered routine of sacrifice and prayer, with
but little trace of the barbarous or grotesque. The
ritual of the Lupercalia is almost a solitary exception.
The Luperci had their foreheads smeared with the blood
of the victims, which were goats, and then this was
wiped off with wool dipped in milk; after this they
were obliged to laugh, probably as a sign that the
god (whoever he was) was in them, or that they were
identified with him.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> They then girt themselves with
the skins of the victims and ran round the ancient
pomoerium, striking at any women they met with
strips of the same victims in order to produce fertility.
This was perhaps a rite taken over from aboriginal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
settlers on the Palatine, and so intimately connected with
that hill that it could not be omitted from the calendar.
The ritual of the three days of Lemuria in May, when
ghosts were expelled from the house, as Ovid describes
the process, by means of beans,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> seems also to have
been a reminiscence of ideas about the dead more
primitive than those which took effect in the more
cheerful Parentalia of February: here again we may
perhaps see a concession to the popular tradition and
prejudice of a primitive population. On the other hand,
the revelry of the Saturnalia in December, of which Dr.
Frazer has made so much in the second edition of the
<i>Golden Bough</i>,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> is nothing more than the licence of the
population of a great cosmopolitan city, an out-growth,
under Greek influence, from the rude winter rejoicings
of the farmer and his <i>familia</i>; and for his conjecture
that a human victim was sacrificed on this occasion in
ancient Rome there is simply no evidence whatever.
There is, indeed, not a trace of human sacrifice at Rome
so long as the <i>ius divinum</i> was the supreme religious
law of the State; in the whole Roman literature of the
Republic hardly anything of the kind is alluded to;<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a>
it is only when we come to an age when the taste for
bloodshed was encouraged by the shows of the amphitheatre,
and when the blood-loving religions of the East
were pressing in, that we hear of human sacrifice, and
then only from Christian writers, who would naturally
seize on anything that came to hand to hold up paganism
to derision, without inquiring into the truth or the history
of the alleged practice.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></p>

<p>Thus we may take it as highly probable that those
who drew up the calendar had the deliberate intention
of excluding from the State ritual, as far as was possible,
everything in the nature of barbarism and magic. For
the religious purposes of a people occupied in agriculture
and war, and already beginning to develop some idea
of law and order, there was no need of any religious
rites except such as would serve, in decency and order,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
to propitiate the deities concerned with the fertilisation
of man, beast, and crop, and with the safety and efficacy
of the host in its struggle with the enemies of the city.
The Roman people grew up, in their city life as in the
life of the family, in self-restraint, dignity, and good order,
confident in the course of <i>cura</i> and <i>caerimonia</i>, itself decent
and stately, if soulless, which the religious authorities
had drawn up for them.</p>

<p>We should naturally like to know something about
those authorities, who thus placed the religion of the State
on a comparatively high level of ritualistic decency, if not
of theological subtlety. The Romans themselves attributed
the work to a priest-king, Numa Pompilius, and probably
their instinct was a right one. Names matter little in such
matters; but there is surely something in the universal
Roman tradition of a great religious legislator, something
too, it may be, in the tradition that he was a Sabine,
a representative of the community on the Quirinal which
had been embodied in the Roman city before the calendar
was drawn up, and of the sturdy, serious stock of central
Italy, which retained its <i>virtus</i> longer than any other
Italian people.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> We are quite in the dark as to all
this, unless we can put any kind of confidence in the
traditional belief of the Romans themselves. But there
is one point on which I should like to make a suggestion&mdash;a
new one so far as I know. Numa was said
to have been the first Flamen Dialis; but that is
absolutely impossible, for the ancient taboos on that
priesthood would have made it impossible for him to
become supreme legislator. Evidently this Flamen,
who could hardly leave his own house, might never
leave the city, and was at every turn hedged in by
restrictions on his activity, was a survival of those
magician-kings who make rain and do other useful
things, but would lose their power if they were exposed
to certain contingencies; the number of possible contingencies
increases till the unfortunate owner of the
powers becomes powerless by virtue of the care so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
painfully taken of him.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> The priest of Jupiter and
his taboos carry us back, beyond a doubt, into the
far-away dim history of primitive Latium. By the
time the eternal city was founded on the Tiber, he
must have been already practically obsolete. My suggestion
is that he is the representative in the Roman
religious system of another and more primitive system
which existed in Latium, probably at Alba, where Jupiter
was worshipped on the mountain from time immemorial.
When the strength of Latium was concentrated at the
best strategical point on the Tiber, the priest of Jupiter
was transferred to the new city, because he was too
"precious" to be left behind, though even then a relic
of antiquity. There he became what he was throughout
Roman history, a practically useless personage, about
whom certain sacred traditions had gathered, but placed
in complete subjection to the new legal and religious
king, and afterwards to the Pontifex maximus.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p>If there be any truth in this&mdash;and I believe it to
be a legitimate inference from the legal position of
this Flamen, and his permanent state of taboo&mdash;then
I think we may see a great religious change in the era
of the "calendar of Numa." Inspired with new ideas
of the duty and destiny of the new city of the four
regions, a priest-king, doubtless with the help and advice
of a council, according to the true Roman fashion, put
an end for ever to the reign of the old magician-kingship,
but preserved the magician-king as a being still capable
of wonder-working in the eyes of the people. As religious
law displaced magic in the State ritual, so the new kings,
with their collegia of legal priests, pontifices and augurs,
neutralised and gradually destroyed the prestige of the
effete survivor of an age of barbarism.</p>

<h4>LECTURE VI</h4>

<h5>THE DIVINE OBJECTS OF WORSHIP</h5>

<p>
We must now turn our attention to what is the most
difficult part of our subject, the ideas of the early Romans
about "the Power manifesting itself in the universe." In
my first lecture I indicated in outline what the difficulties
are which beset us all through our studies; they are in
no part of it so insurmountable as in this. Material fails
us, because there was no contemporary literature; because
the Romans were not a thinking people, and probably
thought very little about the divine beings whom they
propitiated; and again, because comparative religion, as it
is called, is of scant value in such a study. We have to
try and get rid of our own ideas about God or gods, to
keep our minds free of Greek ideas and mythology, and,
in fact, to abstain from bringing the ideas of any other
peoples to bear upon the question until we are pretty sure
that we have some sort of understanding of those Roman
ideas with which we are tempted to compare them. The
first duty of the student of any system of religion is to
study that religion in and by itself. As M. S. Reinach
observed in an address at the Congress for the History of
Religions at Oxford, it is time that we began to attend to
differences as well as similarities; and this can only be
done by the conscientious use of such materials as are
available for the study of each particular religion.
</p><p>
The only materials available in the case of the earliest
Rome are (1) the calendar which I was explaining in the
last lecture, which gives us the names of the festivals of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
religious year; (2) the names of the deities concerned in
these festivals, so far as we know them from later
additions to the calendar, from Roman literature, and from
evidence, chiefly epigraphical, of the names of deities
among kindred Italian peoples; (3) the fragments of
information, now most carefully collected and sifted, about
what the Romans did in the worship of their deities.
The names and order of the festivals, the names of
the deities themselves, the cult, or detail of worship,
including priesthoods and holy places,&mdash;these are the only
real materials we possess, and our only safe guides. To
trust to legends is fatal, because such legends as there
were in Italy were never written down until the Greeks
turned their attention to them, colouring them with their
own fancy and with reminiscences of their own mythology.
For example, no sane investigator would now make use of
the famous story told by Ovid and Plutarch about Numa's
interview with Jupiter, and the astute way in which he
deceived the god, as an illustration of the Roman's ideas
of the divine; we know that it can be traced back to the
greatest liar among all Roman annalists,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> that it was in
part derived from a Greek story, and in part invented to
explain a certain piece of ritual, the <i>procuratio fulminis</i>.
Even what was done in the cult must be handled with
knowledge and discretion. Dr. Frazer has a theory that
the Roman kings personated Jupiter, and uses as evidence
of this the fact that in the triumph the triumphator was
dressed after the fashion of the statue of the god in the
Capitoline temple, with his face reddened with <i>minium</i>:
forgetting that the temple, its cult and its statue, all date
from the very end of the period of the kingship, and were
the work of an Etruscan monarch, almost beyond doubt.
There may be truth in his theory, but this is not the way
to prove it; this is not the way to arrive at a true
understanding of Roman religious ideas.
</p><p>
What did the old Romans know about the nature of
the objects of their worship? All religion is in its
development a process of gaining such knowledge: if it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
makes no progress it is doomed. It is because the Jews
made such wonderful progress in this path, in spite of
formalism and backsliding, that they were chosen to produce
a Teacher whose life and doctrine revealed the will and
the nature of His Father for the eternal benefit of mankind.
The fear of the Lord is imperfect knowledge, it is
but the beginning of wisdom; but it could become, in a
Jew like St. Paul, the perfect knowledge of His will. It
may seem absurd to think of two such religions as the
Jewish and the Roman side by side; but the absurdity
vanishes when we begin to understand the humble beginnings
of the Jewish religion as scientific research has
already laid it bare. Knowledge of the Power manifesting
itself in the universe is open to all peoples alike, and some
few have made much progress in it beside the Jews. The
Romans were not among these, at any rate in all the
later stages of their history; but we have to ask how far
they got in the process, and later on again to ask also
why they could go no farther.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>
</p><p>
We have seen how one great forward step in the
attainment of this knowledge was made in the religion of
the household, when the house had become a kind of
temple, being the dwelling of divine as well as human
beings, and when the cultivated land had been separated
by a sacred boundary from the mountain or forest beyond,
with their wild and unknown spiritual inhabitants. We
met, however, with nothing in the house or on the land
that we can properly call a god, if we may use that word
for the moment in the sense of a personality as well as a
name, and a personality perfectly distinct from the object
in which it resides. Vesta seems to be the fire, Penates
the store, or at least spirits undistinguishable from the
substance composing the store. But inasmuch as the
farmer knew how to serve these spirits and address them,
looking upon them as friends and co-habitants of his own
dwelling, we may go so far as to guess that they were
somewhat advanced in their career as spirits, and might
possibly develop into powers of a more definite kind, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
not into gods, real <i>dei</i> conceived as persons.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> In other
words&mdash;for it is better to keep as far as we can to the
subjective or psychological aspect of them&mdash;the Roman
might realise the Power better by getting to think of his
nameless spirits as <i>dei</i> at work for his benefit if rightly
propitiated. There are some signs in the calendar and
the other sources I mentioned just now that such a process
had been going on before the State arose; and it is certain
that the whole field of divine operation had been greatly
widened by that time, as we might expect from the
enlarged sphere of man's experience and activity.
</p><p>
The deities originally belonging to the city of the four
regions, <i>i.e.</i> to the city of the calendar of Numa, were
known to Roman antiquarians as <i>di indigetes</i>, in contradistinction
from the <i>di novensiles</i> or imported deities, with
which at present we have nothing to do. On the basis of
the calendar, and of the names of the most ancient
priesthoods attached to particular cults, the Rex and the
Flamines, Wissowa (<i>R.K.</i> p. 16) has constructed a list of
these <i>di indigetes</i> which may be accepted without any
further reservation than he himself applies to it. They are
thirty-three in number, but in two cases we have groups
instead of individuals, viz. the Lares and the Lemures:
the plurality of the Lares (<i>compitales</i>) we have already
explained, and the Lemures, the ghosts of departed
ancestors, we may also for the present leave out of account.
Others are too obscure to help us, <i>e.g.</i> Carna, Angerona,
Furrina, Neptunus, Volturnus,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> except in so far as their
very obscurity, and the neglect into which they and
their cults fell in later times, is proof that they were not
thought of as lively personal deities. Then, again, there
are others whose names are suggested by certain festivals,
Terminus, Fons, Robigus, who seem to be simply survivals
from the animistic period&mdash;spirits inherent in the
boundary-stone, the spring, or the mildew, and incapable
of further development in the new conditions of city
life. Faunus, the rural semi-deity, perhaps representing a
group of such beings, appears in the list as the deity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
the Lupercalia; but this is a point in which I cannot
agree with Wissowa and the majority of modern
authorities.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a>
</p><p>
We are struck, as we examine the list further, by the
adjectival character of many of the names&mdash;Neptunus,
Portunus, Quirinus, Saturnus, Volcanus, Volturnus: these
are not proper names, but clearly express some character
or function exercised by the power or <i>numen</i> to whom the
name is given. Saturnus is the most familiar example;
the word suggests no personality, but rather a sphere of
operations (whether we take the name as referring to
sowing or to seed maturing in the soil) in which a certain
<i>numen</i> is helpful. Saturnus, Volcanus, Neptunus were
indeed identified later on with Greek gods of a ripe
polytheistic system, and have thus become quite familiar
to us, far too familiar for a right understanding of early
Roman ideas. We might naturally expect that the
identification of Saturnus with Kronos, of Neptunus with
Poseidon, would give us some clue to the original Roman
conception of the <i>numen</i> thus Graecised, but it is not so.
Neptunus may have had some connection with water, rain,
or springs, but we have no real proof of it, and it is
impossible to say why Saturnus became Kronos.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> The
only certain result that we can win from the study of
these adjectival titles is that they represent a transition
between animism and polytheism, a transition exactly
expressed by the one word <i>numen</i>.
</p><p>
<i>Numen</i> is so important a word in the Roman religion
that it is necessary to be perfectly clear as to what was
meant by it. It must be formed from <i>nuere</i> as <i>flumen</i> from
<i>fluere</i>, with a sense of activity inherent in the verb. As
<i>flumen</i> is that which actively flows, so <i>numen</i> is that which
actively does whatever we understand by the word <i>nuere</i>;
and so far as we can determine, that was a manifestation
of will. <i>Adnuere</i> is to consent, to give your good will to
some act proposed or completed, and is often so used of
Jupiter in the <i>Aeneid</i>. <i>Nuere</i> should therefore express a
simple exercise of will-power, and <i>numen</i> is the being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
exercising it. In time it came to be used for the will of
a god as distinct from himself, as in the fourth
<i>Aeneid</i> (269)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">ipse deum tibi me claro demittit Olympo</span>
<span class="i0">regnator, caelum ac terras qui numine torquet.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Or in the fourth <i>Eclogue</i> (47)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">concordes stabili fatorum numine Parcae,</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>where Servius explains it as "potestate, divinatione, ac
maiestate." But beyond doubt this use is a product of
the literary age, and the word originally indicated the
being himself who exercised the will&mdash;a sense familiar to
us in the opening lines of the <i>Aeneid</i> ("quo numine laeso")
and in innumerable other passages. Thus von Domaszewski
in his collected papers (p. 157) is undoubtedly
right in defining a <i>numen</i> as a being with a will&mdash;"ein
wollendes Wesen"; though his account of its evolution, and
of the way in which in its turn it may produce a <i>deus</i>, may
be open to criticism.
</p><p>
The word thus suggests that the Roman divine beings
were functional spirits with will-power, their functions
being indicated by their adjectival names. Proper names
they had not as a rule, but they are getting cult-titles
under the influence of a priesthood, which titles may in
time perhaps attain to something of the definiteness of
substantival names. This indeed could hardly have been
so in the mind of the ordinary Roman even at a later age;
and it is quite possible that if an intelligent Greek traveller
of the sixth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> had given an account of the gods
of Rome,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> he would have said, as Strabo said of an Iberian
people in the time of Augustus, that they were without
gods, or worshipped gods without names. But the name,
even as a cult-title, is of immense importance in the
development of a spirit into a deity, and in most cases, at
any rate at Rome, it was the work of officials, of a state
priesthood, not of the people. To address a deity rightly
was matter of no small difficulty: how were you to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
know how he would wish to be addressed? Servius tells
us that the pontifices addressed even Jupiter himself thus:
"Iupiter optime maxime, <i>sive quo alio nomine te appellari
volueris</i>." On the other hand, in the same comment he
tells us that "iure pontificio cautum est, ne suis nominibus
di Romani appellarentur, ne exaugurari possent," <i>i.e.</i> lest
they should be enticed away from the city by enemies.
This last statement seems indeed to me to be a doubtful
one,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> but it will serve to illustrate the nervousness about
divine names, of which there is no doubt whatever. We
know for certain that those religious lawyers the pontifices
were greatly occupied with the task of drawing up lists of
names by which <i>numina</i> should be invoked,&mdash;formularising
the ritual of prayer, as we shall see in another lecture;
and this must have become at one time almost a craze
with them, to judge by the lists of Indigitamenta preserved
in their books, to which Varro had access, and which were
copied from him by St. Augustine.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> But after all it
needed the stimulus given by actual contact with a polytheistic
system to turn a Roman numen into a full-fledged
personal deity: the pontifices might carry the process
some way, but they never could have completed it themselves
without the help of the Greeks.
</p><p>
One deity seems to stand alone in the list&mdash;Tellus or
Terra Mater, Mother Earth.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> We are coming directly to
the great deity of the heaven, and we might naturally
expect that an agricultural folk would be much concerned
with her who is his counterpart among so many peoples.
She does not give her name to any of the festivals of the
calendar; but at one of them, the Fordicidia in April, at
a time when the earth is teeming with mysterious power,
and when the festivals are of a peculiarly agricultural
character, she has her own special sacrifice&mdash;a pregnant
cow, whose young are torn from her womb, burnt by the
<i>Virgo vestalis maxima</i>, and their ashes used in certain
mystic rites, <i>e.g.</i> at the Parilia which followed on the
21st.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> She seems to have had her function in human
life as well; but about this we are much in the dark in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
spite of Dieterich's attempts to elucidate it in his <i>Mutter
Erde</i>.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> Whether she played a part at the birth of a
child we cannot be sure; but at marriage there is little
doubt that she was originally an object of worship, though
in later days she gave way before Ceres and Juno.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> And
as at death the body was laid in her embrace, we are not
surprised to find her prominent here also: she was the
home of the dead whether buried or burnt, and of the
whole mass of the Manes. We shall presently see how
a Roman commander might devote himself and the whole
army of the enemy to Tellus and the Manes; and it is interesting
to find that a similar formula of <i>devotio</i>, of later
date, combines Tellus with Jupiter, the speaker touching
the ground when he mentions her name, and holding his
hands upwards to heaven when he names the god.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> Very
curious, too, is the rite of the <i>porca praecidanea</i>, which in
historical times was offered to Ceres as well as Tellus
immediately before harvest; in case a man had wittingly
or unwittingly omitted to pay the proper rites (<i>iusta
facere</i>) to his own dead, it was his duty to make this offering,
lest as a result of the neglect the earth-power should
not yield him a good harvest.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> Originally, we need
hardly doubt, Tellus was alone concerned in this; but
Ceres, who at all times represented rather the ripening
and ripened corn than the seed in the bosom of the
earth, gradually took her place beside her, and the idea
gained ground that the offering was more immediately
concerned with the harvest than with the Manes.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a>
When Cato wrote his book on agriculture, he included in it
the proper formula for this sacrifice, without any indication
that Tellus or the Manes had any part in the business.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a>
Tellus was not a deity whose life would be vigorous
in a busy City-state destined gradually to lose its agricultural
outlook; there the supply of grain, from whatever
quarter it might come, was a far more important matter
than the process of producing it, and it was natural that
Ceres and her April festival should become more popular
than Tellus and her Fordicidia, and that the Cerealia should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
eventually develop into <i>ludi</i> of no less than eight days'
duration. Yet Tellus survived in such forms as that of
the <i>devotio</i>; and even under the Empire we find her as
Terra on sepulchral monuments, <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">ereptam viro et matri mater me Terra recepit,</span>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">terra mater rerum quod dedit ipsa teget.</span>

<p>And there is a curious story, noticed by Wissowa and
by Dieterich after him, that on the death of Tiberius
the plebs shouted not only "Tiberius in Tiberim," but
"Terram matrem deosque Manes," in order that his lot
might be among the <i>impii</i> beneath the earth.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a>
</p><p>
So far we have met with nothing to suggest that the
Roman idea of divinity had passed much beyond an
advanced type of animism; we have found little or no
trace of personal deities of a polytheistic cast. There is,
however, a fact of importance now to be considered,
which has some bearing upon this difficult subject.
Some of the <i>numina</i> of the calendar had special priests
attached to their cults; <i>e.g.</i> among those I have already
mentioned, Volcanus, Furrina, Portunus, and Volturnus,
to which we may now add Pales, Flora, Carmenta,
Pomona, and a wholly unknown deity, Falacer. These
nine all had flamines, a word which is generally derived
from <i>flare</i>, <i>i.e.</i> they were the kindlers of the sacrificial
fire.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> Sacrificing priests they undoubtedly always were,
each limited to the sacrificial rites of a particular cult,
unless authorised by religious law to undertake those of
some other deity whose name he did not bear, and who
was destitute, like Robigus, of a priest of his own.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> We
have no certain evidence that all these flamines were
of high antiquity; but those attached to deities of the
calendar were probably of earlier origin than that
document, and as we have no record of the creation of
a new flaminium in historical times until the era of
Caesar-worship, it is fair to conclude that the others I
have mentioned were not younger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
</p><p>
Now what bearing has this fact on the question as to
how the early Romans conceived the objects of their
worship? There are, of course, so-called priests all the
world over, even among the lowest fetishistic and animistic
peoples, who exercise power over the various kinds
of spirits by potent charms and spells; these should
rather be called wizards, medicine-men, magicians, and
so on.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> But the flamines as we know them were not
such; they were officials of a State, entrusted with the
performance of definite ritualistic duties, more particularly
with sacrifice, and therefore, as we may assume from
universal Roman practice so far as we know it, also with
prayer. If they did not actually slay the victims themselves&mdash;and
in historical times this was done by an
assistant&mdash;they superintended the whole process and
were responsible for its correct performance.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> Does the
existence of such priests come into relation with the
development of the idea of a <i>deus</i> out of a numen or a
spirit? What is the influence of the sacrificing priest on
the divinity whom he serves? This last is a question to
which it is not easy to find a ready answer; the history
of priesthood, and of the moral and intellectual results
of the institution, has yet to be written. Even Dr.
Westermarck, in his recently published great work on
the development of moral ideas, has little to say of it.
It is greatly complicated by the undoubted fact that
among many peoples, perhaps to some extent even among
the Latins, the earliest real priests had a tendency to
personate the deity themselves, to be considered as the
deity, or in some sense divine.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> But in regard to Roman
priests we may, I think, go at least as far as this.
When a spirit was named and localised as a friendly
being at a particular spot within the walls of the city,
which is made over to him, and where he has his <i>ara</i>;
when the ritual performed at this spot is laid down in
definite detail, and undertaken by an individual appointed
for this purpose by the head of the community with
solemn ceremony; then the spirit, hitherto but vaguely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
conceived, must in course of time become individualised.
The priestly if not the popular conception of him is fixed;
there is now no question who he is or how he should be
called; "quis deus incertum est"<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> can no longer be said
of him. Once provided with a flamen and an ordered
cult of sacrifice and prayer, I conceive that he had
now in him the possibility of turning into a <i>deus</i>
personally conceived, if he came by the chance.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> A
few did get the chance; others did not; Volcanus, for
example, became a god after the model of the Greek
Hephaestus, while Volturnus remained a numen and
made no further progress, though he was doubtless
ready to "take" the Graecising epidemic when it came.
I do not say that he or any other numen was the better
for the change. But I must not now pursue the story of
this strange double fate of the old Roman deities; I have
perhaps said enough to show that city life, with its priesthoods
and its ordered ritual, had some appreciable effect
on the deities who were admitted to it.
</p><p>
Among these deities there were four of whom I have
as yet said nothing at all, though they are the most
famous of all the divine inhabitants of Rome. I have
mentioned nine flamines; there were in all twelve, and
besides these there was in historical times a priest known
as the <i>rex sacrorum</i>, the republican successor to some of
the religious functions of the civil king. This rex, and
the three <i>flamines maiores</i>, so called in contra-distinction
to the other nine, were specially attached to the cults of
Janus, Jupiter (<i>Flamen Dialis</i>), Mars (<i>Flamen Martialis</i>),
and Quirinus (<i>Flamen Quirinalis</i>). I have kept these
deities apart from the others already mentioned, not only
because their priests stand apart from the rest, but because
they themselves seem from the first to have been more
really gods (<i>dei</i>); Quirinus is the only one who has an
adjectival name. Two of them, Jupiter and Mars, remained
throughout Roman history of real importance to
the State, and in Jupiter there were at least some germs
of possible development into a deity capable of influencing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
conduct and enforcing morality. Of Janus this cannot
possibly be said; and as he is historically the least
important of the four, I will begin by saying a few words
about him as a puzzle and a curiosity only.
</p><p>
Janus, ever since he ceased to be an intelligible deity,
has been the sport of speculators; and this happened
long before the Roman religion came to an end. In the
last century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> philosophic writers about the gods got
hold of him, and Varro tells us that some made him out
to be the heaven, others the universe (<i>mundus</i>).<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> Ovid
amused himself with this uncertainty of the philosophers,
and in the first book of his <i>Fasti</i> "interviewed" the god,
whose answers are unluckily of little value for us.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> At
various times and in different hands Janus has been pronounced
a sun-god, a heaven-god, a year-god, a wind-god;
and now a Cambridge school of speculators, to whose
learning I am in many ways indebted, has claimed him
as an oak-god, the mate of Diana, the Jupiter of aboriginal
Latium, and so on.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> We have fortunately long left
behind us the age when it was thought necessary to
resolve the Greek and Roman gods into personifications
of natural phenomena, and to try to explain all their
attributes on one principle; but my learned friends at Cambridge
have of late been showing a tendency to return to
methods not less dangerous; they hanker, for example, after
etymological evidence, which in the case of deities is almost
sure to be misleading unless it is absolutely certain, and
supported by the history of the name. This is unluckily
not the case with Janus; his etymology is matter of
dispute,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> and he is therefore open, and always will be so,
to the inquirer who is hunting a scent, and more concerned
to prove a point than to discover what the early
Romans really thought about a god. In this lecture I am
but humbly trying to do this last, and I may therefore
leave etymology, with the mythology and philosophy of a
later age, and confine myself to such facts of the cult of
Janus as are quite undisputed. They will admit of being
put together very shortly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
</p><p>
The first and leading fact is that Janus was the first
deity to be addressed in all prayers and invocations; of
this we have abundant evidence, as also of the corresponding
fact that Vesta came last.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> Secondly, we know
that he was the object of worship on the Kalends of
January, and probably of every month, and that the
sacrificing priest was in this case the <i>rex sacrorum</i>.
Thirdly, we know that he had no temple until the year
260 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, but that he was associated with the famous
gateway at the north-east end of the Forum&mdash;not a gate
in the wall, but a symbolic entrance to the heart of the
city, as the round temple of Vesta at the opposite end,
with its eternal fire, was symbolic of the common life of
the community. Fourthly, we know a few cult-titles of
Janus, among them Clusius (or Clusivius), and Patulcius,
in which the connection with gates is obvious; Junonius,
which may have originated in the fact that Juno also
was worshipped on the Kalends; Matutinus, which seems
to be a late reference to the dawn as the opening or gate
of the day, and Quirinus, which last is also almost
certainly of late origin. Clusius and Patulcius are
genuine old titles, if the text of the Salian hymn is
rightly interpreted; so too is another, Curiatius, for it
was used of the god only as residing in an ancient gateway
near the Subura called the <i>tigillum sororium</i>.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a>
These are all the most important facts we have to go
upon; the double head of Janus on the earliest Roman
<i>as</i> is of uncertain origin, and Wissowa seems to have
conclusively shown that this representation was not
admitted to the gate called Janus Geminus until towards
the close of the republican period.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> The connection of
the god with the fortress on the hill across the Tiber,
which still bears his name, admits of no quite satisfactory
explanation.
</p><p>
Now if we recall the fact that the entrance to the
house and the entrance to a city were points of great
moment, and the cause of constant anxiety to the early
Italian mind, we may naturally infer that they would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
in the care of some particular numen, and that his
worship would be in the care of the head of the family or
community&mdash;in the case of the city, in the care of the
<i>rex</i>, whose duties of this kind were afterwards taken
over by the priest called <i>rex sacrorum</i>. The fact that
the word for an entrance was <i>ianus</i> confirms this conjecture;
Janus was perhaps the spirit guarding the
entrance to the real wall of the earliest city, but when
the city was enlarged in the age from which the calendar
dates, a symbolic gateway was set up where you entered
the forum from the direction of Latium, answering to
the symbolic hearth in the <i>aedes Vestae</i>, and this very
naturally took the name of the deity associated with
entrances. Two other <i>iani</i> probably existed in the forum,
and the name was later on transferred as a substantive to
similar objects in Roman colonies, while a feminine form,
<i>ianua</i>, came to be used for ordinary house entrances.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a>
Whether there ever was a cult of the god at the real
gateway of a city we do not know; there was none at
the symbolic gateway of Rome, which was in no sense a
temple. But the idea of entrance stuck to the old spirit
of the doorway long after the reconstruction of the city,
and the rex now sacrifices to him on the entrance-day of
each month, and more particularly on the entrance-day
of the month which bears his name and is the beginning
of the natural year after the winter solstice. This is the
best account to be had of the original Janus,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> a deity, let
it be remembered, of a simple agricultural and warlike
people, without literature or philosophy. But it is not
difficult to see how, when philosophy and literature did at
last come in a second-hand form to this people, they
might well have overlaid with cobwebs of story and
speculation a deity for whom they had no longer any
real use, who was best known to them by the mysterious
double-head on the <i>as</i> and the gateway, and for whom
they could find no conclusive parallel among the gods of
Greece.
</p><p>
Next in order of invocation to Janus came Jupiter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
and his priest, the Flamen Dialis, was likewise the
second in rank, according to ancient rule, after the <i>rex
sacrorum</i>. Unlike Janus, Jupiter (to use the spelling
familiar in England) was at all times a great power for
the Roman people, and one who could be all the more
valued because he was intelligible. No one doubted then,
and no one doubts now, that he was the god of the light
and of heaven, <i>Diovis pater</i>, or rather perhaps the heaven
itself<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> with all its manifestations of rain and thunder, of
blessing and damage to the works of man; the common inheritance
of the Italian peoples, dwelling and worshipped
in their woods and on their hills; and, as we know now,
also the common inheritance of all Aryan stocks, the
"European Sky-god," as Mr. A. B. Cook has traced him
with learning and ingenuity from the Euxine to Britain.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a>
</p><p>
Jupiter must have had a long and important
history in Latium before the era of the Roman City-state;
Dr. Frazer has seen this, and set it forth in his
lectures on the early history of the kingship, though
basing his conclusions on evidence much of which will
not bear a close examination.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> The one substantial proof
of it lies in the unique and truly extraordinary character
of the taboos placed on his flamen, and to some extent
on the flamen's wife, by the Roman <i>ius divinum</i>. Even
if we suppose that some of these may have been later
inventions of an ecclesiastical college like the pontifices
(and this is hardly probable), many of them are obviously
of remote antiquity, and can only have originated at a
time when the magical power of the man responsible for
the conduct of Jupiter was so precious that it had to be
safeguarded in these many curious ways. I have already
suggested that the scene of the early paramount importance
of Jupiter and his flamen, in that age perhaps a
king of some kind, was Alba Longa, which by universal
tradition was the leading city of Latium before Rome
rose to importance, and where the sky-god was worshipped
on his holy mountain as the religious centre of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>Latium from the earliest times. I have also suggested
that when the new warlike city on the Tiber took the
place of Alba, the worship was transferred thither, but
lost its strength in the process, and that the flamen was
little more than a survival even in the most primitive
period of what we may call for the moment Roman
history. This can be accounted for by the fact that the
traditions of primitive Rome were connected much more
closely with Mars than with Jupiter. Not till Etruscan
kings founded the great temple on the Capitol, which was
to endure throughout all later ages of Roman dominion,
did the sky-god become the supreme guardian deity of
his people, under the titles of Optimus Maximus, the best
and greatest of all her deities.
</p><p>
But Jupiter was there; and we know certain facts of
his cult which give us a pretty clear idea of what the
Romans of the pre-Etruscan period thought about him.
In the calendar all Ides belonged to him, were <i>feriae
Iovis</i>;<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> he seems to be the source of light, whether of
sun or moon, for neither of which the Romans had any
special divinity; in the hymn of the Salii he is addressed
as Lucetius, the giver or source of light. The festivals of
the vintage belonged to him, since the production of wine
specially needed the aid of sun and light, and his flamen
was employed in the cult on these occasions.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> When
rain was sorely needed, the aid of the sky-god was sought
under the cult-title Elicius, and as Fulgur or Summanus<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a>
he was the Power who sent the lightning by day and by
night. The ideas thus reflected in the Roman cult were
common to all Italian peoples of the same stock; everywhere
we find him worshipped on the summits of hills,
and in woods of oak, ilex, or beech,<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> where nothing but
the trees he loved intervened between the heaven and
the earth.
</p><p>
His oldest cult at Rome was on the Capitoline hill,
but at all times quite distinct from that which became so
famous afterwards; he was known here as Feretrius, a
cult-title of which the meaning is uncertain,<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> and here, so
far as we can guess, there must have been an ancient oak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
regarded either as the dwelling of the numen or as the
numen himself, upon which Romulus is said to have hung
the <i>spolia opima</i> taken from the king of the Caeninenses;<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a>
here we may see the earliest trace of the triumphal procession
that was to be. Doubtless an <i>ara</i> was here from the
first, and then followed a tiny temple, only fifteen feet
wide as Dionysius describes it from personal knowledge
in the time of Augustus,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> who restored it. There was no
image of the god, but in the temple was kept a <i>silex</i>,
probably a stone celt believed to have been a thunderbolt;<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a>
this stone the Fetiales took with them on their
official journeys, and used it in the oath, <i>per Iovem lapidem</i>,
with which they ratified their treaties. As the Romans
thought of Jupiter, not as a personal deity living in the
sky like Zeus, but rather as the heaven itself, so they
could think of him as immanent in this stone, <i>Iuppiter
lapis</i>. And the use of the flint in treaty-making suggests
another aspect of the god, which he retained in one way
or another throughout Roman history; it is his sanction
that is called in to the aid of moral and legal obligations,
resulting from treaties, oaths, and contracts such as that
of marriage. As Dius Fidius he was invoked in the
common Roman oath <i>medius fidius</i>; as Farreus (if this
were an old cult-title) he gave his sanction to the solemn
contract entered into in the ancient form of marriage by
<i>confarreatio</i>, where his flamen had to be present, and
where in all probability the cake of <i>far</i> was eaten as a
kind of sacrament by the parties to the covenant.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> In
much of this it is tempting to see, as we can see nowhere
else in the Roman religion, faint traces of a feeling about
the heaven-god brought from a remote pastoral life under
the open sky, where neither forest nor mountain intervened
to shelter man from the great Presence;<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> and it is also
tempting to think that there was here, even for Latins
who had learnt to worship Jupiter under the form of

some chance of the development of a deity "making for
righteousness."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
</p><p>
Third and fourth in the order of invocation came Mars
and Quirinus, and the same order held good for their
flamines. These two priests may have been subject to
some of the taboos which restricted the Flamen Dialis;<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a>
they too, that is, may have been to some extent precious,
and have been endowed in a lost period of history with
magical powers; but if so, the memory and importance of
such disabilities was rapidly forgotten in the City-state,
and they were early allowed to fill civil offices, a privilege
which the Dialis did not attain till the second century
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span><a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> Of the sacrificial duties of the Martialis we know
nothing for certain, and can get no help from him as to
the ideas of the early Romans about their great deity
Mars.
</p><p>
Mars is in some ways the most interesting of all the
Roman deities; but except as the familiar war-god of
Roman history he remains a somewhat doubtful conception.
Like Jupiter and Janus he has attained to a real
name; but of that name, which in various forms is still so
often on our lips, no convincing account has ever been
given. Comparative mythology used to be much occupied
with him, and he has been compared with Indra,
Apollo, Odin, and others. But as M. Reinach said, it is
time to attend more closely to differences; and Mars
seems to stand best by himself, as a genuine Italian
religious conception. His name is found all over ancient
Italy in various forms&mdash;Mavors, Mamers, Marmor, and
as Cerfus Martius at Iguvium. His wild and warlike
character, his association with the wolf and the
spear, seem to suggest the struggle for existence that
must have gone on among the tribes that pushed down
into a peninsula of rugged mountain and dense forest,
abounding with the wolves which are not yet wholly extinct
there. Whether or no his antecedents are to be found in
other lands, we shall not be far wrong in assuming that
the Roman Mars was the product of life and experience
in Italy, and Italy only.
</p><p>
There is an excellent general account of him in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Roscher's article in his <i>Lexicon</i>, which, like that on Janus,
has the advantage of being the result of a second elaborate
study, free from the enticements of the comparative
method. What we know for certain about his cult at
Rome in early times can be very briefly stated. First,
we have the striking fact that he is conspicuous, together
with the Lares, in the <i>carmen</i> which has come down to
us as sung by the Arval Brethren in their lustration of
the cultivated land of the Roman city:<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> "Neve luerve
Marmor sins incurrere in pleores, satur fu fere Mars!"
One is naturally inclined to ask how this wild and warlike
spirit can have anything to do with cultivation and
crops. But there is no mistake; the connection is confirmed
by the fact that he is also the chief object of invocation
in the private <i>lustratio</i> of the farm, which Cato has preserved
for us.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> In each case the victims are the same,
the <i>suovetaurilia</i> of ox, sheep, and pig, the farmer's
most valuable property. Again, let us remember that the
month which bears his name is that not only of the
opening of the war season, but of the springing up of vegetation,
and that the dances and singing of the Salii at this
time may probably have been meant, like similar performances
of savage peoples,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> to frighten away evil demons
from the precious cultivated land and its growing produce,
and to call on the Power to wake to new life. The clue
to the mystery is perhaps to be found in the cult-title
Silvanus which we find in the prayer set down by Cato as
proper for the protection of the cattle when they are on
their summer pasture (<i>in silva</i>): "Marti Silvano in silva
interdius in capita singula boum facito."<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> We know that
wealth in early Italy consisted chiefly of sheep and cattle;
we know that these were taken in the warm months, as
they still are, into the forest (<i>saltus</i>) to feed;<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> and from
this passage of Cato we know that Mars was there. It is
only going one step farther if we conjecture that Mars,
like Silvanus, who may have been an offshoot of his own
being, was for the early settler never a peaceful inhabitant
of the farm or the dwelling, but a spirit of the woodland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
of great importance for the cattle-owner, and of great
importance, too, in all circumambulation of the boundaries
which divided the woodland from the cultivated land.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a>
</p><p>
But with conjecture I deal on principle but sparingly.
It is time to turn to the Mars of the City-state of Rome;
and it is at once interesting to find that until the age of
Augustus, who introduced a new form of Mars-worship,
he had no temple within the walls, and even outside only
two <i>fana</i>, one an altar in his own field the Campus
Martius, the other a temple dedicated in 388 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> outside
the Porta Capena. "He was always worshipped outside
the city," says Dr. J. B. Carter in his <i>Religion of Numa</i>,
"as a god who must be kept at a distance." Should we
not rather say that the god was unwilling to come within
those sacred boundaries encircling the works of man? So
stated, we may see in this singular fact a reminiscence of
the time when Mars was really the wild spirit of the
"outland," where wolves and human enemies might be
met with; he was perhaps in some sense a <i>hostis</i>, a
stranger, like the many other deities originally strange to
Rome who, until the second Punic war, were never
allowed to settle within the sacred precincts.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> In one
sense, however, Mars was actually resident in the very
heart of the city. In a <i>sacrarium</i> or chapel of the regia,<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a>
the ancient dwelling of the king, were kept the spears and
shields which the Salii carried in their processions in
March and October; and that the deity was believed to
be there too must be inferred from the fact, if it be
correctly stated by Servius, that the consul who was about
to take the field entered the chapel and shook these
spears and shields together, saying, "Mars vigila." I am,
however, rather disposed to think that this practice belongs
to a time when Mars was more distinctly recognised as a
god of war, and when the weapons of the Salii were
thought of rather as symbols of his activity than as
objects in which he was immanent.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a>
</p><p>
These are the salient facts in the oldest cult of Mars,
and they are entirely in keeping with all we know of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
early history and economy of the Roman people&mdash;a people
economically dependent on agriculture, and especially on
cattle-breeding, living in settlements in the midst of a
wilder country, and constantly liable to the attacks of
enemies who might raid their cattle and destroy their
crops. I do not see in him only a deity of agriculture, or
only a god of war; in my view he is a spirit of the
wilder regions, where dwell the wolf and woodpecker
which are connected with him in legend: a spirit who
dwells on the outskirts of civilisation, and can with profit
be propitiated both for help against the enemies beyond,
and for the protection of the crops and cattle within, the
boundaries of human activity.
</p><p>
Fourth in invocations came Quirinus, and fourth in
order of precedence was his flamen. But of Quirinus I
need say little; there is, on the whole, a consensus of
opinion that he was a form of Mars belonging to the
community settled on the hill that still bears his name.
The most convincing proof of his identity with Mars
(though identity is doubtless too strong a word) lies in
the well-known fact that there were twelve Salii Collini,
<i>i.e.</i> belonging to the Collis Quirinalis, occupied with the
cult of Quirinus, answering to the twelve Salii Palatini of
the cult of Mars. "Quid de ancilibus vestris," Camillus
says in Livy's glowing rhetoric, "Mars Gradive (the particular
cult-title of the warlike Mars), tuque Quirine
pater?"<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> Now the Quirinal was, of course, <i>within</i> the
walls, and the Romans who identified the two deities noted
this point of contrast with the Mars-cult; for Servius
writes, "Quirinus est Mars qui praeest paci et <i>intra civitatem</i>
colitur, nam belli Mars <i>extra civitatem</i> templum habet."
In keeping with this is the use of the word Quirites of the
Romans in their civil capacity; but unluckily we are
altogether uncertain as to the etymology and history of
both Quirites and Quirinus.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> And as Quirinus never
became, like Mars, an important property of the Roman
people, but was speedily obscured and only revived by
the legend of late origin which identified him with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Romulus, he is not of importance for my subject, and I
may leave him to etymologists and speculators.
</p><p>
There is one other deity of whom I might naturally
be expected to say something; I mean Juno. But our
familiarity with Juno in Roman literature must not be
allowed to lead us into believing too rashly that she was
one of those great <i>numina</i> of the early Roman State with
whom I have just been dealing. She had no special
festival in the calendar;<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> her connection with the Kalends
she shared, as we have seen, with Janus. She had no
special priest of her own; for in spite of all assertions
that the flaminica Dialis was attached to her cult, I am
convinced that I was right some years ago in maintaining
that this is an error, though a natural one.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> It cannot
be proved that she had any ancient temple in the city;
for the oldest known to us as strictly indigenous, that of
Juno Moneta on the arx, was not dedicated till 344 <i>b.c.</i>,
and we do not know that there was an older altar on the
same spot.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> Assuredly Rome was not in early times a
great centre of the Juno cult, as were some of the cities in
her neighbourhood, <i>e.g.</i> Lanuvium, Falerii, and Veii;<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> and
the gradual establishment of her position as a truly Roman
goddess may be explained by her appearance in the trias
of deities in the Capitoline temple at the end of the regal
period, and by the removal to Rome of Juno Regina of
Veii still later, after the destruction of that city.
</p><p>
What, then, was Juno originally to the Roman religious
mind? There is no more difficult question than this in
our whole subject; as we probe carefully in those dark
ages she baffles us continually. Undoubtedly she was
a woman's deity, and we may aptly say of her "varium et
mutabile semper femina." The most singular fact we know
about her cult is that women used to speak of their Juno
as men spoke of their Genius;<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> and it is not by any
means impossible that this may be the clue to the original
Italian conception of her.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> In that case we should have
to explain her appearance as a well-defined goddess in so
many Latin towns, as the anthropomorphising result of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
that penetration of Greek ideas into Latium from the
south, of which I shall have something to say later on.
Such ideas, when they reached Rome, may have produced
the notion that she was the consort of Jupiter, for which I
must confess that I can find no sufficient evidence in the
early cult of either.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> But I must here leave her, for in
truth she does not belong to this lecture; and it would
need at least one whole lecture to discuss her adequately
in all her later aspects. The latest German discussion of
her occupied sixty closely printed pages; and instructive
as it was in some ways, arrived at the apparently impossible
conclusion that she was a deity of the earth.
</p><p>
Last in the order of invocation, even to the latest days
of Rome, came Vesta, "the only female deity among the
highest gods of the most ancient State,"<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> for Juno can
hardly be reckoned among them, and Tellus had no
special cult or priesthood of her own. We have already
noticed Vesta as the religious centre of the house, making
it into a <i>home</i> in a sense almost more vivid than that in
which we use the sacred word. Through all stages of
development from house to city this religious centre must
have been preserved, and in the Rome of historical times
Vesta was still there, inherent in her sacred hearth-fire,
which was tended by her six virgin priestesses, and
renewed on the Roman New Year's day (March 1) by the
primitive method of friction.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> The Vestals beyond doubt
represented the unmarried daughters of the primitive
Latin family, and the <i>penus Vestae</i>, a kind of Holy of
Holies of the Roman State, recalled the <i>penus</i> or store-closet
of the agricultural home; this <i>penus</i> was cleansed
on June 15 for the reception of the first fruits of the
harvest, and then closed until June 7 of the following
year.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> These and other simple duties of the Vestals, all
of them traceable to the old life on the farm, together
with their own sex and maidenhood, preserved this beautiful
cult throughout Roman history from all contamination.
Vesta in her <i>aedes</i>, a round dwelling which was never a
temple in the technical sense, was represented by no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
statue, and her title of Mater never suggested to the true
Roman worshipper anything but her motherly grace and
beneficence.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> Far more than any other cult, that of Vesta
represents the reality and continuity of Roman religious
feeling; and the remains of her latest dwelling, and the
statues of her priestesses with no statue of herself among
them, may still give the visitor to the Forum some dim
idea of the spirit of Roman worship.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a>

from the second book of Valerius Antias, whose bad reputation is
well known. It was plainly meant to account for the cult-title of
Jupiter Elicius, and the origin of the <i>procuratio fulminis</i>, and
was invented by Greeks or Graecising Romans at a time (2nd
century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) when all reverence for the gods had vanished as completely

know, and probably never shall know, the original deity concerned in
that festival. The ritual is wholly unlike that of the <i>rustica Faunalia</i>

the formation of real gods&mdash;possibly from an aboriginal people who
did not know any. (I am glad to see this view taken in the latest
summary of German learning on this subject, <i>Einleitung in die

At the moment of printing an interesting discussion of the Lupercalia,

are good passages for the principle. The latter alludes to the anxiety
of <i>veteres Romani</i> on this point, "ne alium pro alio nominando falsa
religione populum alligarent." Hence the formulae "si deus si dea,"
or "sive quo alio nomine fas est nominare," Serv. <i>Aen.</i> ii. 351;

from the want of substantival names in so many Roman deities;
surely, it would be argued, the pontifices must have had some reason
for this. It is contradicted by the fact that in such ancient formulae
as that of the <i>devotio</i> (Livy viii. 9) the great gods are called by their
own names, though the army was in the field and in presence of the
enemy. There was, however, an old idea that the name of the special
tutelary god of the city was never divulged, lest he should become
<i>captivus</i>, and that the true name of the city itself was unknown; see
Macrob. iii. 9. 2 foll. I believe that these ideas were encouraged by
the pontifices, but were not founded on fact.</p></div>

reckoned sufficiently with the tendency of a legal priesthood, devoted
to the strict maintenance of religious minutiae, to elaborate and
organise the material for god-making which was within their reach.
To judge by the elaboration of the ritual at Iguvium, the same
tendency must have existed in other kindred Italian communities,
both to develop ritualistic priesthoods, and through them to elaborate
the ritual. This is, I think, the weak point of Usener's reasoning in
his <i>G&ouml;tternamen</i>, and as applied to Roman deities it is the weak
point of an interesting article by von Domaszewski, reprinted in his

as we know it was probably an institution of the city. I must own
that I am quite uncertain as to what the thing was which was originally

something to say on the subject in his book on the Roman religion in

essentially true; but my point is that localisation and ritual prepared
the way for the reception of Greek ideas of personality. The process
had already begun in the religion of the house; but it was not likely
there to come in contact with foreign germs. When Janus and Vesta,
who were in every house (Wissowa, p. 285), were localised in certain
points in a city, they would be far more likely to acquire personality,
if such an idea came in their way, than in the worship of the family.</p></div>

mundum." Dr. Frazer, citing this passage (<i>Kingship</i>, p. 286) in
support of his view that Janus was a duplicate of Jupiter, has omitted
to notice that some theorisers fancied he was the <i>universe</i>, which by
itself is enough to betray the delusive nature of this kind of theological
speculation. Varro elsewhere gives us a clue to the liability of Janus
to be exalted in this unnatural fashion, <i>L.L.</i> vii. 27, "divum deo" (in the
Salian hymn), if this be taken as referring to Janus, as it may be,
comparing Macrob. i. 9. 14. But this is easily explained by the
position of Janus in prayers; cp. Cic. <i>Nat. Deor.</i> ii. 27. 67, "cum in
omnibus rebus vim haberent maximam prima et extrema, principem in
sacrificando Ianum esse voluerunt." The phrase "Deorum" or "Divum
deus" is indeed remarkable, and unparalleled in Roman worship; but
no one acquainted with Roman or Italian ritual will for a moment
suspect it of meaning "God of gods" in either a Christian or metaphysical
sense. I shall have occasion to notice the peculiar use of
the genitive case and of genitival adjectives in worship later on. See

account belongs to a late period. But Varro seems to have stated
that there was originally only a spear; see a passage of Clement of
Alexandria in the fragments of the <i>Ant. rer. div.</i>, Agahd, p. 210,
to which Deubner (<i>l.c.</i>) adds Arnobius vi. 11. Deubner calls this
spear a fetish, which is not the right word if the deity were immanent
in it in the sense suggested by "Mars vigila." See above,

with the clashing of shields and spears by the Salii, which may

connect both names with the Greek word &#960;&#961;&#8150;&#957;&#959;&#987;, and Professor
Conway, quoted by him, is inclined to lend the weight of his great
authority to the conjecture. Thus Quirinus would be an oak-god,
and Quirites oak-spearmen. We must, however, remember that Mr.
Cook is, so to speak, on an oak scent, and his keenness as a hunter
leads him sometimes astray. One is a little perplexed to understand
why Jupiter, Janus, Mars, and Quirinus should all be oak-gods (and
all in origin identical as such!). On the other hand, it is fair to note
that the original spear was probably of wood, with the point hardened
in the fire, like the <i>hasta praeusta</i> of the Fetiales: Festus, p. 101. If
<i>quiris</i> has really anything to do with oaks, it would be more natural
to explain the two words as springing from an old place-name, Quirium,
as Niebuhr did long ago, and to derive that again from the oaks
among which it may have stood. But I am content to take <i>quiris</i> as
simply a spear, as Buecheler did; see Deubner, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 76. Since
the above was written, the article "Quirinus" by Wissowa in the
<i>Myth. Lex.</i> has appeared. Naturally it does not add anything to our
knowledge; but Wissowa holds to the opinion that the most probable
derivation of the name Quirinus is from Quirium, possibly the name
of the settlement on the Quirinal; and compares <i>Q. pater</i> (<i>e.g.</i> Livy

these. But so far I cannot follow him.</p></div>

<h4>LECTURE VII</h4>

<h5>THE DEITIES OF THE EARLIEST RELIGION: GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS</h5>


<p>In the last lecture we interrogated the calendar as to the
deities whose festivals are recorded in it, with the aid of
what we know of the most ancient priesthoods attached to
particular cults. The result may be stated thus: we
found a number of impersonal <i>numina</i>, with names of
adjectival form, such as Saturnus, Vertumnus, and so on;
others with substantival names, Tellus, Robigus, Terminus;
the former apparently functional deities, concerned in the
operations of nature or man, and the latter spirits immanent
in objects&mdash;Mother Earth herself, a stone, the
mildew, or (like Janus and Vesta) the entrance and the
hearth-fire of human dwellings or cities. Lastly, we found
from the evidence, chiefly of the priesthoods, that certain
more important divinities stand out from the crowd of
spirits, Janus, Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus, and Vesta; and we
found some reason to think that these, and possibly a few
of the others, by becoming the objects of priestly <i>cura</i> and
<i>caerimonia</i> at particular spots in the city, were not unlikely
to become also in some sense personal deities, to acquire a
quasi-human personality, if they came by the chance. In
the present lecture I must go rather more closely into such
evidence as we possess bearing on the mental conception
which these early Romans had formed of the divine beings
whom they had admitted within their city.</p>

<p>And, first, we must be quite clear that in those early
ages there was nothing in Rome which we can call a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
temple, as we understand the word; nor was there any
such representation of a deity as we can call an image or
<i>eidolon</i>. The deities were settled in particular spots of
ground, which were made <i>loca sacra</i>, <i>i.e.</i> handed over to the
deity by the process of <i>consecratio</i> authorised by the <i>ius
divinum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> It was matter of no moment what might be
erected on this bit of ground; there might be a rude
house like that of Vesta, round in shape like the oldest
Italian huts; there might be a gateway like that of Janus;
or the spot might be a grove, or a clearing within it (<i>lucus</i>),
as in the case of Robigus or the Dea Dia of the Arval
Brethren. All such places might be called by the general
name <i>fanum</i>; and as a rule no doubt each <i>fanum</i> contained
a <i>sacellum</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a small enclosure without a roof,
containing a little altar (<i>ara</i>). These "altars" may at
first have been nothing more than temporary erections of
turf and sods; permanent stone altars were probably a
later development. Servius tells us that in later times it
was the custom to place a sod (<i>caespes</i>) on the top of such
a stone altar, which must be one of the many survivals in
cult of the usages of a simpler age.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a></p>

<p>With such spots as these we cannot associate anything
in the nature of an image of the deity established there;
and we have every reason to believe that no such thing
was known at Rome until the Etruscan temple of the
Capitoline trias was built near the end of the regal period.
Varro expressly declared that the Romans remained for
more than 170 years without any images of their gods,
and added that those who first introduced such images
"civitatibus suis et metum dempsisse et errorem addidisse."<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a>
What he had in his mind is clear; he had indeed no
direct knowledge of those early times, but he is thinking
of a definite traditional date in the kingly period&mdash;the
last year of the reign of Tarquinius Priscus, who, according
to Varro's own account, built the temple on the
Capitol and placed in it a statue of Jupiter.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> That was
the oldest image of which he knew anything; and, as
Wissowa has remarked, his belief is entirely corroborated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
by the fact that in every single case in which the image of
a god has any part in his cult, it is always either this
Capitoline Jupiter or some deity of later introduction and
non-Roman origin. It is also borne out by another significant
and interesting fact&mdash;that the next image to be
introduced, that of Diana in the temple on the Aventine,
was a copy of the &#958;&#8001;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#957; of Artemis at Massilia, itself a
copy of the famous one at Ephesus.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> Let us note that
these two earliest statues were placed in roofed temples
which were the dwelling-places of gods in an entirely new
sense; so far no Roman deity of the city had been so
housed, because he could not be thought of in terms of
human life, as visible in human form and needing shelter.
But this later and foreign notion of divinity so completely
took possession of the minds of the Romans of the cosmopolitan
city that Varro is the only writer who has preserved
the tradition of the older way of thinking. In the religion
of the family Ovid indeed has charmingly expressed it,
perhaps on the authority of some lost passage of Varro<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">ante focos olim scamnis considere longis</span>
<span class="i1">mos erat, et mensae credere adesse deos.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tibullus in one passage has mentioned what seems to be
some rude attempt to give outward shape and form to an
ancient pastoral deity<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">lacte madens illic suberat Pan ilicis umbrae</span>
<span class="i1">et facta agresti lignea falce Pales.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And Propertius hints at a like representation of Vertumnus,
the garden deity. But without some corroborative evidence
it is hardly safe to take these as genuine examples
of early iconic worship.</p>

<p>Thus we may take it as certain that even the greater
deities of the calendar, Janus, Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus, and
Vesta, were not thought of as existing in any sense in
human form, nor as personal beings having any human
characteristics. The early Romans were destitute of
mythological fancy, and as they had never had their
deities presented to them in visible form, could hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
have invented such stories about them as sprang up in a
most abundant crop when Greek literature and Greek art
had changed their mental view of divinity. Roman
legends were occupied with practical matters, with kings
and the foundation of cities; and even among these it is
hardly possible to detect those which may be really
Roman, for they are hidden away, like rude ancient
frescoes, under the elaborate decorations of the Greek
artists, who seized upon everything that came to hand,
including the old deities themselves, to amuse themselves
and win the admiration of their dull pupils at Rome.
He who would appreciate the difficulty of getting at the
original rude drawings must be well acquainted with the
decorative activity of the Alexandrian age.</p>

<p>Thus we might well presume <i>a priori</i> that the old
Roman gods were not conceived as married pairs, nor as
having children; and this is indeed the conclusion at
which we have arrived after half a century or more of
most careful and conscientious investigation by a series
of German scholars. But quite recently in this country
the contrary view has been put forward by an author of
no less weight than Dr. Frazer; and another eminent
Cambridge scholar, Mr. A. B. Cook, evidently inclines to
the same view. I should in any case be reluctant to
engage in controversy with two valued personal friends;
but it is just possible that in what follows I may be able
to throw some faint light on the evolution of the idea of
marriage among divine beings; and on the strength of
this I am content for the moment to be controversial. Dr.
Frazer's arguments, with strictures on my opinions, will be
found in an appendix to his book on <i>Adonis</i>, <i>Attis</i>, <i>Osiris</i>,
2nd edition.</p>

<p>In pure animism the spirits are nameless; when their
residence and functions are more clearly recognised they
acquire names, and these names are naturally masculine
or feminine among peoples whose language is not genderless,
as was the case with the Sumerians of Babylonia.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a>
This would seem to be the first step on the path to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
personal conception of divinity. But there are signs that
the Romans had not got very far on this path when we
begin to know anything about their religion. I have
already alluded to the formula "Sive deus sive dea," which
occurs in the ritual of the Fratres Arvales, in the formula
given by Cato for making a new clearing, and elsewhere;<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a>
and indeed there seems to have been always some uncertainty
about the sex of one or two well-known deities,
such as Pales and Pomonus or Pomona.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> It is not,
therefore, <i>a priori</i> probable that the process of personalisation
(if I may coin the word) should have proceeded, at
the period we are treating of, so far as to ascribe to these
named deities of both sexes the characteristics of human
beings in social life and intercourse. Yet Varro, as Dr.
Frazer points out, is quoted by St. Augustine as saying
that his ancestors (that is, as Augustine adds), "veteres
Romanos," believed in the marriage of gods and in their
procreative power.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> If Varro wrote "maiores meos," as
he seems to have done, of whom was he really thinking?
Was Augustine's comment based on the rest of Varro's
text, or was he jumping to a conclusion which would
naturally serve his own purpose? Varro, of course, was
not a Roman, but from Reate in the Sabine country.
But even if he were thinking of Rome, how far back
would his knowledge extend? The Romans had known
Greek married gods for three or four centuries before his
time, and he may quite well be thinking of these. Of
the <i>di indigetes</i> of an earlier period he could hardly know
more than we do ourselves; his only sources of information
were the facts of the cult and the books of the pontifices.
The facts of the cult, so far as he and others have
recorded them, suggest no pairing of deities, no "sacred
marriage."<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> The pontifical books, which contained rules
and formulae for the proper invocation of deities by their
right names, do indeed seem to have suggested a certain
conjunction of male and female divine names; and it is
just possible that this is what Varro had in his mind
when he wrote the passage seized upon by Augustine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
I will proceed at once to examine this evidence, as it is
incidentally of great interest in the history of Italian
religion; and Dr. Frazer will probably allow that his
conclusion must stand or fall by it.</p>

<p>The evidence to which I allude is preserved in the
13th book of the <i>Noctes Atticae</i> of Aulus Gellius (ch.
xxiii.), and extracted from "libri sacerdotum populi
Romani," as "comprecationes deorum immortalium";
these also occur, he says, in <i>plerisque antiquis orationibus</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> in the invocations to the gods made by the orator
at the beginning or end of his speech.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> Among
these Gellius found the following conjunctions of divine
names: Lua Saturni, Salacia Neptuni, Hora Quirini,
Virites Quirini, Maia Volcani, Herie Iunonis, Moles
Martis, and Neriene Martis, or Nerio Martis. Now among
these conjunctions there are three which obviously do not
express pairs of deities, married or other, viz. Virites Quirini,
Moles Martis, and Herie Iunonis; the first two of which
plainly mean the strength or force of Quirinus and Mars,
and the third conjoins two female names. The question
is whether the others are to be understood as giving us
the names of the "wives" of Saturnus, Neptunus, Quirinus,
Volcanus, and Mars. The fact that these are associated
with others which cannot mean anything of the kind is
itself against this conclusion; but I have carefully examined
each pair by the light of such stray information
about them as we possess, and have failed to find anything
to suggest Dr. Frazer's emphatic conclusion that
these are married pairs. I should be tedious if I were to
go through the evidence in detail in a lecture like this;
but I will take the pair which Gellius himself discusses,
and on which Dr. Frazer chiefly relies, Neriene or Nerio
Martis: it is the pair about which we know most, and in
every way is the most interesting of the set.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></p>

<p>After giving the list of names, Gellius goes on to
express his own opinion that <i>Nerio Martis</i> means (like
<i>Moles Martis</i>) the <i>virtus</i> or <i>fortitudo</i> of Mars, <i>Nerio</i> being
a Sabine word meaning strength or courage;<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
little further he sums up his view thus: "Nerio igitur
Martis vis et potentia et maiestas quaedam esse Martis
demonstratur." This seems to fit in very comfortably
with what can be guessed of the meaning of two of the
other pairs, Virites Quirini and Maia Volcani: Maia was
explained by another Roman scholar as equivalent to
Maiestas.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></p>

<p>But Gellius goes on to quote three passages from old
Latin authors in which Nerio (or Neria) appears positively
as the wife of Mars; and again concludes that there
was also a tradition that these two were <i>coniuges</i>. Of
these passages we luckily have the context of one, for it
occurs in the <i>Truculentus</i> of Plautus: turning this out
(line 515) we find that a rough soldier, arriving at
Athens, salutes his sweetheart with the words "Mars
peregre adveniens salutat Nerienen uxorem suam"&mdash;words
which Plautus must have adapted from his Greek
original in such a way as to make them intelligible to a
Roman audience. Gellius says that he had often heard
a learned friend blame Plautus for thus putting a false
notion about Mars (that he had a wife) into the mouth of
his soldier&mdash;"nimis comice"&mdash;merely to produce a comic
effect. But, he adds, there was some justification for it;
for if you read the third book of the annals of Gellius
(a namesake who lived in the second century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) you
will find that he puts into the mouth of Hersilia, pleading
for peace before Ti. Tatius, words which actually make
Nerio the wife of Mars: "De tui, inquit, coniugis consilio,
Martem scilicet significans." Little, I fear, can be
said to the credit of this Gellius;<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> he lived in an age
when annalists were many and inventive, and long after
the Romans had grown accustomed to Greek ideas of
the gods; but we may take this passage as evidence of
what may have been in his day a popular idea of Mars
and his consort. Lastly, Aulus Gellius quotes a brace of
lines from one Licinius Imbrex, an old comic writer of
the same century, who, in a <i>fabula palliata</i> called Neaera,
wrote:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">nolo ego Neaeram te vocent, aut Nerienem,</span>
<span class="i0">cum quidem Marti es in connubium data.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The real question is whether these passages from comic
writers and an annalist of no reputation combine to prove
that there was an ancient popular idea of Mars as a
married god; as to the priestly view of the matter they
can, of course, prove nothing. It seems to me that Dr.
Frazer is entitled to argue that in the second century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
such a popular idea existed,<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> which the Roman state
religion did not recognise, and which Aulus Gellius, as
we have seen, could not agree with. I do not, however,
think him entitled to go farther, and to infer that this was
an idea of divinity native to Italy or of very old standing.
Is it not much simpler to suppose, with a cool-headed
scholar whom Dr. Frazer is willing to follow when it suits
his turn, that pairs or conjunctions of this kind, the true
meaning of which I hope to explain directly, were easily
mistaken by the vulgar mind for married god and goddess?<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">309</a>
In those degenerate days of the Roman religion,
after the war with Hannibal, to which these writers
belong&mdash;and all are later than Ennius, the first to make
mischief by ridiculing the gods&mdash;nothing could be easier
than to take advantage of what looked like married life
to invent comic passages to please a Roman audience,
now consisting largely of semi-educated men who had
lost faith in their own religion, and of a crowd of smaller
people of mixed descent and nationality. Such passages,
in fact, cannot safely be used as evidence of religious
ideas, apart from the tendencies of the age in which they
were written. Had there really been religious beliefs,
rooted in the old Roman mind, about the wedded life
of gods and goddesses, it would even then have been
dangerous to use them mockingly in comedy. And once
more, had there been such genuinely Roman ideas, why,
in an age that made for anthropomorphism, did they not
find their way into the Roman Pantheon,&mdash;why did they
survive only in literary allusions, to the bewilderment of
scholars like Aulus Gellius?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>The real explanation of these curious conjunctions of
masculine and feminine names is, I think, not very hard
to come by. Let us remember, in the first place, that
they were found in the books of the priests, and that
they belonged to forms of prayer&mdash;<i>comprecationes deorum
immortalium</i>; in other words, they do not represent
popular ideas of the deities, but ritualistic forms of invocation.
As such they may indeed no doubt be regarded
as expressing, or as growing out of, a popular way of
thinking of the Power manifesting itself in the universe;
but they are themselves none the less, like those strange
lists of divine names called <i>Indigitamenta</i>, with which I
shall deal directly, the creations of an active professional
priesthood, working upon the principle that every deity
must be addressed in precisely the correct way and no
other, and accounting the name of the deity, as indicating
his or her exact function, the most vitally important thing
in the whole invocation. I have already pointed out how
difficult the early Latin must have found it to discover
how to address the <i>numina</i> at work around him, and I
shall return to the subject in another lecture; at present
all I want to insist upon is that the priests of the City-state
relieved him of this anxiety, and indeed must have
carried the work so far as to develop a kind of science
of divine nomenclature. Every one who has studied the
history of religions knows well how strong the tendency
is, when once invocation has become ritualised, for the
names and titles of the objects of worship to abound and
multiply. The Roman Church of to-day still shows this
tendency in its elaborate invocation of the Virgin.</p>

<p>With the old Romans the common method of elaboration
lay in the invention of cult-titles, of which the different
kinds have been distinguished and explained by Dr.
J. B. Carter in his treatise "de Deorum Romanorum
cognominibus."<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> Most of them are suggestive of function
or character, as, <i>e.g.</i>, Janus Patulcius Clusivius, or
Jupiter Lucetius, Ops Opifera; sometimes they doubled
the idea, as in Aius Locutius, or Anna Perenna, or Fors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Fortuna; and in one or two cases they seem to have
combined two deities together in rather puzzling conjunctions,
which usually, however, admit of some possible
explanation, as Janus Junonius, or Ops Consiva (<i>i.e.</i> Ops
belonging to Consus).<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> In the Iguvian ritual, which is
the highly-elaborated work of a priesthood as active as
the Roman, we find combinations of not less than four
names:<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> Cerfe Martie, Praestita Cerfia Cerfi Martii, Tursa
Cerfia Cerfi Martii, which may perhaps be rendered
"Spirit of Mars, protecting (female) spirit of the (male)
spirit of Mars, fear-inspiring (female) spirit of the (male)
spirit of Mars."</p>

<p>Such strange multiple combinations as these suggest
that expressions like Moles Martis or Virites Quirini are
only another form of the usual cult-title, expressing adoration
of the power of the deity addressed; and it is only
reasonable to explain the others of the same group on the
same principle. As we have seen, Roman scholars themselves
explained Nerio Martis as equivalent to Virtus
Martis; Herie Iunonis probably means something of the
same kind; the others are not so easily explained, and
guesswork about them is unprofitable. But I hope I
have said enough to show that there is absolutely no good
ground for supposing that these combinations of names in
nominative and genitive indicate a relationship of any
kind except a qualitative one. Abstract qualities, let us
note, are usually feminine in Latin, and I think it is not
improbable that abstractions such as Fides and Salus,
which were deified at a very early period at Rome, may
have reached divinity by attachment to some god from
whom they subsequently became again separated.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> And
lastly, we can trace the same tendency to combine names
and ideas together far down the course of Roman history;
witness the combination of Genius with cities, legions,
gods, etc., as well as with the individual man, and again
such expressions as Pietas Legionis, by analogy with
which von Domaszewski, wrongly as I think, would
explain those we have been discussing.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>Before leaving this complicated and cloudy system of
divine nomenclature, it is as well to ask the question once
more, even if we cannot answer it, whether if left to itself
it might have developed into a polytheistic system of
personal deities. I will give my own opinion for what it
is worth. I do not think that such a result could have
been reached without the magic touch of the Greek poet
and artist, or the arrival of Greek deities and their images
in Latium. Professor Sayce, in his Gifford lectures on the
religion of Babylonia, has shown how the non-Semitic
Sumerians knew only of spirits and demons until the
Semite arrived in the Persian Gulf with his personal gods
of both sexes;<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> and I gather that he does not suppose
that without such immigration the Sumerian ideas of
divinity could have become personalised. The question is
not exactly the same at Rome; for there the spirit world
had passed into the hands of an organised priesthood
occupied with ritual, and especially with its terminological
aspect; and the chance of personalisation, if it were there
at all, lay in the importance of the functional name. But
the question is after all beside the mark; we shall see
what happened when the Greeks arrived. We may be
content at present to note the fact that they found the
functional terminology sufficiently advanced to take advantage
of it, and to revolutionise the whole Roman
conception of the divine.</p>

<p>Dr. Frazer gives me an opportunity of adverting to
another point bearing on the question we are discussing,&mdash;the
way in which the old Roman thought of his deities.
"It is difficult," he says,<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> "to deny that the epithets
Pater and Mater, which the Romans bestow on so many
of their gods, do really imply paternity and maternity;
if this implication be admitted, the inference appears to
be inevitable that these divine beings were supposed to
exercise sexual functions, etc." In a footnote he adds a
number of formidable-looking references, meant, I suppose,
to prove this point. I have closely examined these
passages; what they do prove is simply that many deities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
were called Pater and Mater. Not one even suggests that
paternity and maternity were in such cases to be understood
literally and, so to speak, physically. The two
that come nearest to what he is looking for are those
from Varro and Lactantius. Varro says<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> that Ops was
called Mater because she was identical with Terra, who
was, of course, Terra Mater: "Haec enim&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'terris gentes omnes peperit et resumit denuo,</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>quae dat cibaria,' ut ait Ennius."<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> It is clear, then, that
neither Varro nor Ennius understood this title of Ops and
Terra in Dr. Frazer's sense of the word. The quotation
from the early Christian father Lactantius, which contains
three well-known lines of Lucilius, might possibly
deceive those who neglect to turn it out and read the context;
there we find at once that not even Lactantius
could attribute to these epithets the meaning which Dr.
Frazer wishes to put on them. He would have been as
glad to do so as Dr. Frazer himself, though for a very
different reason; but what he actually wrote is this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Omnem Deum qui ab homine colitur, necesse est
inter solennes ritus et precationes patrem nuncupari, non
tantum honoris gratia, verum etiam rationis; quod et
antiquior est homine, et quod vitam, salutem, victum
praestat, ut pater. Itaque ut Iuppiter a precantibus pater
vocatur, etc."<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></p>

<p>Dr. Frazer's quotation begins with this last sentence;
it is a pity that he did not read the context. If he had
read it, his candour would have compelled him to confess
that not even a Christian father, with a keen sense of
what was ridiculous or degrading in the pagan religion,
understood the fatherhood of the gods as he wishes to
understand it.</p>

<p>But I am wasting time in pressing this point. Dr.
Frazer would hardly have used such an argument if he
had not been hard put to it. The figurative use of human
relationships is surely a common practice, when addressing
their deities, of all peoples who have reached the stage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
of family life. As another distinguished anthropologist
says: "The very want of an object tends to supply
an object through the imagination; and this will be
either the vital energy inherent in things, or the reflex
of the human father, who once satisfied his needs (<i>i.e.</i>
of the worshipper). So, in Aryan religions, the supreme
god is father, &#918;&#949;&#8058;&#962; &#960;&#945;&#964;&#7969;&#961;, Diespiter, Marspiter. Ahura-Mazda
is a father.... Another analogy shows the
relationship of brother and friend, as in the case of
Mithra."<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> The Romans themselves were familiar from
the first with such figurative use of relationship, as was
natural to a people in whom the family instinct was so
strong; we have but to think of the <i>pater patratus</i> of the
Fetiales,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> of the Fratres Arvales, or the Fratres Attiedii of
Iguvium. What exactly they understood by Pater and
Mater when applied to deities is not so easy to determine:
we have not the necessary data. They were never applied,
I believe, to imported deities, <i>di novensiles</i>; always to
<i>di indigetes</i>, those on whom the original Roman stock
looked as their fellow-citizens and guardians. And we
shall not be far wrong if we conclude that in general
they imply the dependence of the human citizen upon his
divine protector, and thus bring the usage into line with
that of other Aryan peoples. Behind this feeling of
dependence there may have been the idea, handed down
from remote ages, that Father Sky and Mother Earth
were in a sense the parents of all living things; but there
is nothing in the Roman religion to suggest that the two
were thought of as personally uniting in marriage or a
sexual act.</p>

<p>I will sum up this part of the discussion by translating
an admirable passage in Aust's book on the Roman
religion, with which I am in cordial agreement<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">322</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The deities of Rome were deities of the cult only.
They had no human form; they had not the human heart
with its virtues and vices. They had no intercourse with
each other, and no common or permanent residence; they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>enjoyed no nectar and ambrosia ... they had no children,
no parental relation. They were indeed both male
and female, and a male and female deity are often in close
relations with each other; but this is not a relation of
marriage, and rests only on a similarity in the sphere of
their operations.... These deities never become independent
existences; they remain cold, colourless conceptions,
<i>numina</i> as the Romans called them, that is,
supernatural beings whose existence only betrays itself in
the exercise of certain powers."</p>

<p>They were, indeed, cold and colourless conceptions as
compared with the Greek gods of Olympus, whose warmth
and colour is really that of human life, of human passions;
but the one remarkable and interesting thing about these
Roman and Italian numina is the life and force for good
or evil which is the very essence of their being. The
puzzling combinations we have just been studying are
quite enough to illustrate this character. Moles, Virites,
Nerio, and perhaps others too, seem to mean the strength
or force inherent in the numen; Cerfius, or Cerus, as the
Latins called it, Liber, Genius, all are best interpreted as
meaning a functional or creative force. Jupiter is the sky
or heaven itself, with all its manifestations of activity;
Tellus is Mother Earth, full of active productive power.
At the bottom of these cold and colourless conceptions
there is thus a real idea of power, not supernatural but
rather natural power, which may both hurt and benefit
man, and which he must attempt to enlist on his side.
This enlistment was the task of the Roman priesthood
and the Roman government, and so effectually was it
carried out that the divine beings lost their vitality in
the process.</p>

<p>We shall be better able to follow out this curious fate
of the Roman deities in later lectures; here I wish to note
one other aspect of the Roman idea of divinity, which
will help to explain what I have just been saying about
the life and force inherent in these numina.</p>

<p>In most cursory accounts of the Roman religion it has
been the practice to lay particular stress upon an immense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
number of "gods," as they used to be called, each of
which is supposed to have presided over some particular
act or suffering of the Roman from the cradle to the
grave&mdash;from Cunina, the "goddess" of his cradle, to
Libitina who looked after his interment. I have as yet
said nothing about all these. I will now briefly explain
why I have not done so, and why I hesitate to include
them, at any rate in the uncompromising form in which
they are usually presented, among the genuine religious
conceptions of the earliest period. Later on I shall have
further opportunity of discussing them; at the end of
this lecture I can only sum up the results of recent
research into this curious cloud of so-called deities.</p>

<p>We know of them mainly, but not entirely, from
Tertullian, and the <i>de Civitate Dei</i> of St. Augustine.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">323</a>
These scholarly theologians, wishing to show up the
absurdity of the heathen religions, found a mine of
material in the great work of Varro on the Roman religious
antiquities; and though they found him by no means so
elegant a writer as Cicero, they studied him with pains,
and have incidentally added immensely to our knowledge
both of Varro himself and of the Roman religion. St.
Augustine tells us that it was in the last three books of
his work that Varro treated of the Roman deities, and
that he divided them under the heads of <i>di certi</i>, <i>di incerti</i>,
and <i>di selecti</i>. In the first of these he dealt chiefly with
those with which we are now concerned: they were <i>certi</i>
because their names expressed their supposed activity
quite clearly.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> We know for certain that Varro found
these names in the books of the pontifices, and that they
were there called Indigitamenta:<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> a word which has been
variously interpreted, and has been the subject of much
learned disputation. I believe with Wissowa that it means
"forms of invocation," <i>i.e.</i> the correct names by which gods
should be addressed.</p>

<p>Thus these lists of names come down to us at third
hand: Varro took them from the pontifical books, and
the Christian fathers took them from Varro. It is obvious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
that this being the case they need very careful critical
examination; and till recently they were accepted in full
without hesitation, and without reflection on such questions
as, <i>e.g.</i>, whether they are psychologically probable, or
whether they can be paralleled from the religious experience
of other peoples. Some preliminary critical attempts
were made about fifty years ago in this direction,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> but the
first thoroughgoing examination of the subject was published
by R. Peter in the article "Indigitamenta" in
Roscher's <i>Mythological Lexicon</i>. This most industrious
scholar, though his interpretation of the word Indigitamenta
is probably erroneous,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> was the first to reach the
definite conclusion that the lists are not really primitive,
and do not, as we have them, represent primitive religious
thought. It was after a very careful study of this article,
which is long enough to fill a small volume, that I wrote
in my <i>Roman Festivals</i> of the Indigitamenta as "based
on"&mdash;not actually representing, I might have added&mdash;"old
ideas of divine agency, now systematised by something
like scientific terminology and ordered classification
by skilled legal theologians"; and as "an artificial priestly
exaggeration of a primitive tendency to see a world of
nameless spirits surrounding and influencing all human
life."<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></p>

<p>I was not then specially concerned with the Indigitamenta,
and only alluded to them in passing. But before
my book was published there had already appeared a
most interesting work on the names of deities (<i>G&ouml;tternamen</i>)
by H. Usener, a brilliant investigator, which
drew fresh attention to the subject. Usener found in
mediaeval records of the religion of the heathen Lithuanians
what seemed to be a remarkable parallel with this
old Roman theology, and he also compared these records
with certain facts in what we may call the pre-Olympian
religious ideas of the Greeks. "The conclusion which
he draws," writes Dr. Farnell<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a>&mdash;and I cannot state it
better&mdash;"is that the Indo-Germanic peoples, on the way to
the higher polytheism, passed through an earlier stage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
when the objects of cult were beings whom he designated
by the newly-coined words 'Augenblickg&ouml;tter' and
'Sonderg&ouml;tter'" (gods of momentary or limited function).
He went further than this, and claimed that the
anthropomorphic gods of Greece and Italy, of the Indo-Iranians,
Persians, and Slavs, were developed out of
these spirits presiding over special functions and particular
moments of human life; but with this latter part of his
theory I am not now concerned. What we want to know
now is whether in writing thus of the Roman Indigitamenta
Usener was using a record which really represents an early
stage of religious thought in Italy; and I may add that we
should be glad to know whether his Lithuanian records
are also to be unhesitatingly relied on.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> As regards
Greece, Dr. Farnell has criticised his theories with considerable
effect.</p>

<p>The most recent contribution to the discussion of the
Roman part of the subject is that of Wissowa, who in
1904 published a paper on "True and False Sonderg&ouml;tter
at Rome";<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> this is a piece of most valuable and
weighty criticism, but extremely difficult to follow and
digest. I here give only the main results of it. Wissowa
takes two genuine examples of Sonderg&ouml;tter which have
come down to us from other sources, and more directly than
those mentioned above: the first from Fabius Pictor, the
oldest Roman historian,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> and the other from the Acta
Fratrum Arvalium.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> Fabius said that the flamen
(Cerealis?), when sacrificing to Tellus and Ceres, also
invoked the following deities: Vervactor, for the first
ploughing, as Wissowa interprets it; Redarator, for the
second ploughing; Imporcitor, for the harrowing; Insitor,
for the sowing; Oberator, for the top-dressing; Occator,
Sarritor, Subrincator, Messor, Convector, Conditor, Promitor,
for subsequent operations up to the harvest and
actual distribution of the corn for food. Secondly, in the
Acta of the Arval Brethren we find, on the occasion of a
<i>piaculum</i> caused by the growth of a fig-tree on the roof
of the temple of Dea Dia, at the end of a long list of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
deities invoked, and before the names of the <i>divi</i> of the
Imperial families, the names of three Sonderg&ouml;tter,
Adolenda Commolenda Deferunda, and on another occasion,
Adolenda and Coinquenda; these seem beyond
doubt to refer to the process of getting the obnoxious
tree down from the roof, of breaking it up, and burning it.</p>

<p>In both these examples, which have come down to us
more directly than the lists in the Fathers, Wissowa sees
assistant or subordinate deities (if such they can be called)
grouped around a central idea, that of the main object
of sacrifice in each case;<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> these are the result of the <i>cura</i>
and <i>caerimonia</i> supervised and over-elaborated by pontifical
law and ritual. It is, I may add on my own account,
most unlikely, and psychologically almost impossible, that
any individual farmer should have troubled himself to
remember and enumerate by name twelve deities
representing the various stages of an agricultural process;
and Cato, in fact, says nothing of such ritual. It was the
flamen of the City-state, who, when sacrificing to Tellus
and Ceres before harvest,<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> pictured, or recalled to mind,
the various processes of a year of what we may call high
farming rather than primitive, under the names of deities
plainly invented out of the words which express those
processes&mdash;words which themselves are certainly not all
antique. And in the second example, which dates from
the second century <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, we see that the process of
destroying the intruding fig-tree is represented in ritual
in exactly the same curious way: the names of the deities,
Deferunda and the rest, being invented for the occasion
out of the words which express the several acts of the process
of destruction. These Arval Brethren of the second
century inherited the traditions of their predecessors of an
earlier age, and carried out the work of amplification in
their invocations by pedantically imitating the pontifices
of five or six centuries earlier. They held, in a way which
to us is ludicrous, to the old notion that you should try
and cover as much ground as possible in worship, and to
cover it in detail, so that no chance might be missed of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
securing the object for which you were taking so much
trouble.</p>

<p>Now to return to Varro and his lists of names. What
is Dr. Wissowa's conclusion about these, after examining
the two examples of Sonderg&ouml;tter which have not come
down to us through so much book-learning as the rest?</p>

<p>Varro's <i>di certi</i>, he says<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">336</a>&mdash;and I think there is
no doubt that he is right&mdash;included the name of every
deity, great or small, of which he could feel sure that
he knew something, as he found it in the books of the
pontifices; and the part of those books in which he
found these names, known as Indigitamenta, probably
contained formulae of invocation, <i>precationum carmina</i>,<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">337</a>
of the same kind as the <i>comprecationes deorum immortalium</i>
from which Gellius quoted the pairs of male and
female deities which we discussed above. Varro arranged
all these names in groups of principal and subordinate
or assistant deities, the latter amplifying in detail the
meaning and scope of the former, as we have just seen;
and of this grouping some traces are still visible in the
accounts of Augustine and Tertullian. But the good
Fathers tumbled the whole collection about sadly in
their search for material for their mockery, having no
historical or scientific object in view; with the result
that it now resembles the bits of glass in a kaleidoscope,
and can no longer be re-arranged on the original Varronian
plan. The difficulty is increased by the etymologies
and explanations which they offer of the divine names,
which, as a rule, are even more absurd than the divinities
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></p>

<p>But, in the last place, the question must be asked
whether these Sonderg&ouml;tter of the real kind, such, for
example, as those twelve agricultural ones invoked by the
flamen at the Cereale sacrum, had their origin in any
sense in popular usage or belief. At the end of his
paper Wissowa emphatically says that he does not believe
it. For myself, I would only modify this conclusion so
far as this: they must, I think, have been the theological,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
or perhaps rather the ritualistic outcome, of a psychological
tendency rooted in the popular mind. I have already
noticed that curious bit of folklore in which three spirits
of cultivation were invoked with a kind of acted parable
at the birth of a child;<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> and I cannot regard this custom
as a piece of pontifical ritualism, though the names may
have been invented by the priests to suit the practice.
The old Roman seems to have had a tendency to ascribe
what for want of a better word we may call divinity, not
only to animate and inanimate objects, but to actions and
abstractions; this, I take it, is an advanced stage of
animism, peculiar, it would seem, to a highly practical
agricultural people, and it is this stage which is reflected
in the ritualistic work of the priests. They turned dim
and nameless powers into definite and prehensible deities
with names, and arranged them in groups so as to fall
in with the life of the city as well as the farm. What was
the result of all this ingenuity, or whether it had any
popular result at all, is a question hardly admitting of
solution. What is really interesting in the matter, if
my view is the right one, is the curious way in which
the early Roman seems to have looked upon all life
and force and action, human or other, as in some sense
associated with, and the result of, divine or spiritual
agency.</p>

"Stipes acernus eram, properanti falce dolatus, Ante Numam grata
pauper in urbe deus." The question is whether these are genuine
examples of the natural evolution of a "stock or stone" into something
in the nature of an anthropomorphic image of a deity, or
whether they are the result of the introduction of Greek statues acting
on the popular mind in rustic parts of Italy. The passages, so far
as I know, stand alone, and we have no means of deciding whether
the anthropomorphic tendency was native or foreign. Vortumnus
was, however, undoubtedly of Etruscan origin; Wissowa, <i>R.K.</i> p. 233.
The subject of iconic development of this kind is well summarised in
E. Gardner's little volume on <i>Religion and Art in Ancient Greece</i>,
ch. i.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_298_298" id="Footnote_298_298"></a><a href="#FNanchor_298_298"><span class="label">298</span></a> See Sayce, <i>Gifford Lectures on the Religions of Egypt and
Babylonia</i>, p. 302. An interesting paper on the evolution of <i>dei</i> at
Rome out of functional <i>numina</i> will be found in von Domaszewski's
<i>Abhandlungen zur r&ouml;m. Religion</i>, p. 155 foll., based on Usener's
theory of Sonderg&ouml;tter. It is ingenious and imaginative, but in
my view does not square with the facts as far as we know them.
His stages are: (1) momentary function of <i>numina</i>, <i>e.g.</i> lightning;
(2) elevation of this into a permanent power or function; (3) consequent
limitation of the numen to a special well-marked function;
(4) elevation of the numen to a <i>deus</i>, conceived in the likeness of
man, and male or female, because man cannot think of power
otherwise than on the analogy of male or female creative energy.
Lastly, when the <i>deus</i> is complete, the functions of the former
numen become attributes or qualities, traces of which we find in the
pairs of deities in Gellius, xiii. 23, which are discussed later on in
this lecture. Some of these, of course, eventually became separate
deities&mdash;Salacia, Maia, Lua. As I cannot accept the view that
the earliest Roman idea of the supernatural is to be found in
<i>comprecationes</i> of a comparatively late period, <i>i.e.</i> in the so-called
Indigitamenta, this charmingly symmetrical account has no charm
for me beyond its symmetry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_301_301" id="Footnote_301_301"></a><a href="#FNanchor_301_301"><span class="label">301</span></a> The passage runs thus (Aug. <i>C.D.</i>. iv. 32): "Dicit enim
(Varro) de generationibus deorum magis ad poetas quam ad
physicos fuisse populos inclinatos, et ideo et sexum et generationes
deorum maiores suos (id est veteres credidisse Romanos) et eorum
constituisse coniugia." There is an amusing passage in Lactantius,
i. 17 (<i>de Falsa Religione</i>), which Dr. Frazer might read with
advantage. It begins, "Si duo sunt sexus deorum, sequitur
concubitus." Then he goes on mockingly to argue that the gods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
must have houses, cities, lands which they plough and sow, which
proves them mortal. Finally he takes the whole series of inferences
backwards, finishing with "si domibus carent, ergo et
concubitu. Si concubitus ab his abest, et sexus igitur foemineus,"
etc. All this, he means, can be inferred from the fact that gods
are of both sexes; but that they have <i>concubitus</i> can no more be
inferred from his argument than that they plough and sow.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_302_302" id="Footnote_302_302"></a><a href="#FNanchor_302_302"><span class="label">302</span></a> Dr. Frazer conjectures a sacred marriage of Jupiter and Juno
under the forms of Janus and Diana, in <i>Kingship</i>, p. 214; but
he is well aware that it is pure guesswork. There was, indeed,
at Falerii such a marriage of Juno with an unknown deity (Ovid,
<i>Amores</i>, iii. 13), of which, however, we do not know the history.
Falerii was one of those cities, like Praeneste, where Etruscan,
Greek, and Latin influences met. The "Orci nuptiae" on which
Frazer lays stress was simply the Greek marriage of Pluto and
Proserpine: "Orci coniux Proserpina," Aug. <i>C.D.</i> vii. 23 and 28,
Agahd, p. 152. Wissowa shows this conclusively, <i>R.K.</i> p. 246.
Orcus was Graecised as Plutus, but was himself totally without
personality.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_303_303" id="Footnote_303_303"></a><a href="#FNanchor_303_303"><span class="label">303</span></a> Dr. Frazer wrongly translates this as "ancient prayers"
(p. 411), adding "the highest possible authority on the subject."
<i>Oratio</i> is never used in this sense until Christian times: the word
is always <i>precatio</i>. All scholars are agreed that what is meant
is invocations to deities in old speeches, such as occur once or twice
in Cicero (<i>e.g.</i> at the end of the <i>Verrines</i>); cp. Livy xxix. 15. As the
recording of speeches cannot be assumed to have begun before the
third century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, this does not carry us very far back. That
century is also the age in which the pontifices were probably most
active in drawing up <i>comprecationes</i>; see below, p. 285 foll.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_305_305" id="Footnote_305_305"></a><a href="#FNanchor_305_305"><span class="label">305</span></a> Cp. Ovid, <i>Fasti</i>, iii. 850, "<i>forti</i> sacrificare deae." In <i>R.F.</i>
p. 60 foll., I have criticised the attempts, ancient and modern, to
make this Nerio the subject of myths.</p></div>

nature of these feminine names, and probably betrays the real
meaning of Maia. I may mention here that Bellona instead of
Nerio is ascribed as wife to Mars by Seneca ap. Aug. <i>C.D.</i> vi. 10;
also Venus to Volcanus instead of Maia. Neither have any connection,
so far as we know, with the gods to whom Seneca ascribes
them as wives: Venus-Vulcan is, of course, Greek. Both Augustine
and Dr. Frazer might with advantage have abstained from citing
Seneca on such a point: as a Spaniard by birth he was not likely
to know much about technical questions of Roman ritual.</p></div>

after Aust had thoroughly investigated the cult of Jupiter for his
article in the <i>Mythological Lexicon</i>; in which cult, if anywhere, one
may be tempted to see evidence of a personal conception of deities.
As Dr. Frazer has referred to the cult of Jupiter at Praeneste,
to which I referred him as evidence of a possibly personal conception
of the god in that Latin city, I may say here that I adhere to what
I said about this in <i>R.F.</i> p. 226 foll.; no piece of antique cult has
occupied my attention more than this, and I have tried to lay open
every source of confirmation or criticism. Wissowa has expressed
himself in almost exactly the same terms in <i>R.K.</i> p. 209: we
arrived at our conclusions independently.</p></div>

4 on p. 9. I have no doubt that Wissowa is right in explaining
Indigitamenta as "Gebetsformeln," formulae of invocation; in which
the most important matter, we may add, would be the name of
the deity. See his <i>Gesammelte Abhandlungen</i>, p. 177 foll. The

<h4>LECTURE VIII</h4>

<h5>RITUAL OF THE <i>IUS DIVINUM</i></h5>


<p>I have already frequently mentioned the <i>ius divinum</i>,
the law governing the relations between the divine and
human inhabitants of the city, as the <i>ius civile</i> governed
the relations between citizen and citizen.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> When we
examined the calendar of Numa, we were in fact examining
a part of this law; we began with this our studies of
the religion of the Roman city-state, because it is the
earliest document we possess which illuminates the dark
ages of city life, so far as religion is concerned. The
study of the calendar naturally led us on to consider the
evidence it yields, taken together with other sources of
information, as to the nature of the deities for whose
worship it fixes times and seasons, or, more accurately,
the amount of knowledge to which the Romans had
attained about their divine beings. But we must now
return to the <i>ius divinum</i>, and study it in another aspect,
for which the calendar itself does not suffice as evidence.</p>

<p>Perhaps the simplest way of explaining this <i>ius</i> is to
describe it as laying down the rules for the maintenance
of right relations between the citizens and their deities;
as ordaining what things are to be done or avoided in
order to keep up a continual <i>pax</i>, or quasi-legal covenant,
between these two parties. The two words <i>ius</i> and <i>pax</i>,
we may note, are continually meeting us in Roman
religious documents. In a prayer sanctioned by the
pontifices for use at the making of a new clearing, we
read: "Si deus, si dea sit cuius illud sacrum est, <i>ut tibi</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
<i>ius siet</i> porco piaculo facere illiusce sacri coercendi ergo,"<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">341</a>
<i>i.e.</i> "O unknown deity, whether god or goddess, whose
property this wood is, let it be legally proper to sacrifice
to thee this pig as an expiatory offering, for the sake of
cutting down trees in this wood of thine." "Pacem
deorum exposcere" (or "petere") is a standing formula, as
all readers of Virgil know;<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> and it occurs in many other
authors and religious documents. When Livy wants to
express the horror of the old patrician families at the
idea of plebeians being consuls&mdash;men who had no knowledge
of the <i>ius divinum</i> and no right to have any&mdash;he
makes Appius Claudius exclaim, "Nunc nos, tanquam
iam nihil pace deorum opus sit, omnes caerimonias
polluimus."<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> How can we maintain our right relations
with the gods, if plebeians have the care of them?</p>

<p>Thus it is not going too far to describe the whole
Roman religion of the city-state as a <i>Rechtsverkehr</i>,<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a>
a legal process going on continually. When a <i>colonia</i>
was founded, <i>i.e.</i> a military outpost which was to be a
copy in all respects of the Roman State, it was absolutely
essential that its <i>ius divinum</i> should be laid down; it
must have a religious charter as well as a civil one.
Even at the very end of the life of the Republic, when
Caesar founded a colony in Spain, he ordained that,
within ten days of its first magistrates taking office, they
should consult the Senate "quos et quot dies festos esse
et quae sacra fieri publice placeat et quos ea sacra facere
placeat," <i>i.e.</i> as to the calendar, the ritual, and the priesthood.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a>
The Romans, of course, assumed that Numa, their
priest-king, had done the same thing for Rome; Livy
describes him as ordaining a pontifex to whom he entrusted
the care of all these matters, with written rules to
follow.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> This was the imaginary religious charter of the
Roman State. Without it the citizen, or rather his
official representative, would not know with the necessary
accuracy the details of the <i>cura</i> and <i>caerimonia</i>; without
it, too, the deities could not be expected to perform their
part of advancing the interests of the State, and indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
as I think we shall find, could not be expected to retain
the strength and vitality which they needed for the work.
Support was needed on each side; the State needed the
help of the gods, and the gods needed the help of the
State's care and worship.</p>

<p>The ways and means towards the maintenance of this
<i>pax</i> were as follows. First, the deities must be duly
placated, and their powers kept in full vigour, by the
ritual of sacrifice and prayer, performed at the proper
times and places by authorised persons skilled in the
knowledge of that ritual. Secondly, there must be an
exact fulfilment of all vows or solemn promises made
to the deities by the State or its magistrates, or by such
private persons as might have made similar engagements.
Thirdly, the city, its land and its people, must
be preserved from all evil or hostile influences, whether
spiritual or material or both, by the process broadly known
as <i>lustratio</i>, which we commonly translate <i>purification</i>.
Lastly, strict attention must be paid to all outward signs
of the will of the gods, as shown by omens and portents
of various kinds. This last method of securing the <i>pax</i>
became specially prominent much later in Roman history,
and I prefer to postpone detailed discussion of it for
the present; but the other three we will now examine,
with the help of evidence mainly derived from facts of
cult, not from the fancies of mythologists.</p>

<p>First, then, I take sacrifice, dealing only with the
general principles of sacrificial rites, so far as we can discern
them in the numerous details which have come down to
us. The word <i>sacrificium</i>, let us note, in its widest sense,
may cover any religious act in which something is made
<i>sacrum</i>, <i>i.e.</i> (in its legal sense) the property of a deity;<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">347</a>
I am not now concerned to conjecture what exactly may
have been the meaning of this immortal word before it
was embodied in the <i>ius divinum</i>. "Sacrificium" is limited
in practical use by the Romans themselves to offerings,
animal or cereal, made on the spot where the deity had
taken up his residence, or at some place on the boundary of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
land or city (<i>e.g.</i> the gate) which was under his protection,
or (in later times at least) at a temporary altar erected
during a campaign. Thus it was as much a sacrificium
when the paterfamilias threw at each meal a portion of
the food into the fire, the residence of Vesta, as when the
consul offered a victim to Mars on the eve of a battle.</p>

<p>Sacrifices have generally been divided into the three
classes of (1) honorific, where the offering is believed to be
in some sense a gift to the deity; (2) piacular, or sin-offerings,
where the victim was usually burnt whole, no
part being retained for eating (though this was not the
case at Rome); (3) sacramental sacrifices, where the
worshippers enter into communion with the deity by
partaking of the sacred offering together with him.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> The
two former are constant and typical in the Roman
religion; but traces of the sacramental type, which
Robertson Smith believed to be the oldest, are also
found, and it will clear the ground if I refer to them at
once. By far the most interesting example is that of the
Latin festival on the Alban mount, where the flesh of
the victim, a white heifer that had never felt the yoke,
was partaken of by the deputies of all the cities of the
Latin league, great importance being attached to the due
distribution.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> Here the Latin race "yearly acknowledges
its common kinship of blood, and seals it by
partaking in the common meal of a sacred victim," thus
entering into communion with Jupiter, the ancient god of
the race, and with each other, by participation in the flesh
of the sacred animal. "This common meal is perhaps a
survival from the age when cattle were sacred animals,
and were never slain or eaten except on the solemn
annual occasions when the clan or race renewed its
kinship and its mutual obligations by a solemn sacrament."
It is tempting to compare with this great
sacrament the <i>epulum Iovis</i> on the Ides of September, the
dedication-day of the Capitoline temple of Jupiter, Juno,
and Minerva, which three deities seem to have been
present in visible form to share the meal with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
magistrates and senate.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> But we have not yet arrived
at the age when this temple was built, and we have no
evidence enabling us to carry the rite back in any form
to the pre-Etruscan period. There are, however, faint
indications that the old Italians believed the deities to be
in some sense present at their meals, though not in visible
form; and at one festival, the Fornacalia, which was a
concern not of the State as a whole, but of the thirty
<i>curiae</i> into which it was divided,<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> there seems to be no
doubt that a common meal took place in which the gods
were believed to have a part, or at any rate to be present
though invisible. Yet the <i>ius divinum</i> of the Roman
State assuredly did not encourage this kind of sacrament;
for in the regular round of State festivals, in which we
cannot include even the <i>feriae Latinae</i>, the sacrifices, so
far as we are informed, were all honorific or piacular. If
I am not mistaken, the idea of participation by the
people in solemn sacred rites was discouraged by the
Roman priesthood; in the <i>ius divinum</i> the line drawn
between <i>sacrum</i> and <i>profanum</i> was clear; scenes of
gluttony or revelry, like the Greek hecatombs, were
eliminated from the <i>sacra publica</i>, as I have already
pointed out. Not till the advent of the Sibylline books
and the <i>Graecus ritus</i> did the people take an active part
in the State religion; their duty was merely to abstain
from disturbance during the performance of sacred rites.
"Feriis iurgia amovento" is the only reference in Cicero's
imaginary sketch of the <i>ius divinum</i> to the conduct of
the citizen on festival days.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">352</a>[352] Within the family, the
curia, the gens, there might be direct and active participation
in daily or yearly ceremonies, but it was an essential
principle of the life of the city-state that its business,
religious as well as civil, should be carried out for the
citizens by officials specially appointed.</p>

<p>In the typical and organised worship of the State, <i>i.e.</i>
sacrifice honorific and piacular, sanctioned by the <i>ius
divinum</i>, the utmost care was taken that the whole procedure
should be in every sense acceptable to the deity;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
that nothing <i>profanum</i> should cross the threshold of
the divine; hence it was quiet, orderly, dignified. The
feeling that communication with the deity invoked was
impossible save under such conditions was very strong
in the Roman mind, stronger perhaps than with any
other people whose religious practice is known to us;
and the sense of obligation and duty, <i>pietas</i>, as they called
it, was thus very early developed, and of infinite value to
the State in its youth. This is entirely in keeping with
what we have learnt in the last two lectures of the ideas
of the Romans about the nature of their deities, and throws
additional light on those ideas. They did not as yet
know too much about the divine beings and their powers
and wishes; familiarity had not yet bred contempt;
<i>religio</i>, as we saw, was still strong among them&mdash;the
feeling of awe that is likely to diminish or disappear when
you have your god before you in the form of an idol. It
is a principle of human nature that where knowledge is
imperfect, care must be taken to be on the safe side; this
is true of all practical undertakings, and as the religion of
the Romans was that of a practical people with a practical
end in view, it was particularly true of them.</p>

<p>First then, in order that the worship might be entirely
acceptable to the deity invoked, it was essential that the
person who conducted it should be also acceptable. At
the head of the whole system was the rex, who was
priest as well as king. We do not know, of course,
exactly how the rex was appointed; but in the case of
the typical priest-king Numa, Livy has described his
<i>inauguratio</i> in terms of the <i>ius divinum</i> of later times for
the appointment of priests, and we may take it as fairly
certain that the same principle held good from the earliest
times.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> After being summoned (so the story ran) from
the Sabine city of Cures by the Senate, he consulted the
gods about his own fitness. He was then conducted by
the augur to the arx on the Capitol, and sat down on a
stone facing the south. The augur took his seat on his
left hand (the lucky side) with veiled head, holding the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
<i>lituus</i><a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> of his office in his right hand, with which, after
a prayer, he marked out the <i>regiones</i> from east to west,
the north being to the left, the south to the right, and
silently noted some object in the extreme distance of the
<i>ager Romanus</i>, as the farthest point where the appearance
of an omen might be accepted. Then, passing the <i>lituus</i>
to his left hand, he laid his right on the head of Numa,
and uttered this prayer: "Father Jupiter, if it be thy will
(<i>fas</i>) that this Numa Pompilius, on whose head my hand
is laid, be king of Rome, I pray thee give us clear token
within the limits which I have marked out." Then he
said aloud what auspicia he sought for (<i>i.e.</i> whether of
birds, lightning, or what); and when they appeared, Numa
descended as rex from the citadel. This process was
called <i>inauguratio</i>; it is attested for the confirmation of
the election of the three flamines maiores, the rex, and
the augurs, in historical times,<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> whatever was the method
of that election, and without it the priest was not believed
to be acceptable to the gods. It is not mentioned by
Roman writers in connection with the Pontifices or the
Vestals; if this be not merely from dearth of evidence, it
is not easy to account for, unless the reason were that
neither body was specially concerned with sacrifice. But
the principle is perfectly clear&mdash;that the person who is to
represent the community in worship must be one of whom
the <i>numina</i> openly express approval.</p>

<p>A priest, <i>sacerdos</i>, is thus a person set apart by special
ritual for the service of the <i>sacra populi Romani</i>. The
rex no doubt himself made the selection and supervised
the inauguratio of the other priests at whose head he was.
When the kingship came to an end, his powers of this
kind passed to the pontifex maximus; and it may be as
well to add at once that his sacrificial powers, though they
were in a special sense inherited by a priest who took his
title, the <i>rex sacrorum</i>, passed with the civil power to all
magistrates <i>cum imperio</i>, who wore the <i>toga praetexta</i>
symbolic of priestly function, and had the right of presiding
at sacrificial rites both at home and in the field.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Thus magistrate and priest, though quite distinct under
the Republic from the point of view of public law, have
certain characteristics in common as deriving from a
common source in the powers of the rex.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">356</a></p>

<p>But to return to the period of Numa and the calendar:
it was not only necessary that the priest should be acceptable
to the gods, but that he should be marked off from
the rest of the community as being dedicated to their
service. As Dr. Jevons says,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> in all early religions
priests are marked off from other worshippers, partly by
what they do, and partly by what they may not do; and
what he means is (1) that the priest originally was the
person who alone could slay a victim; (2) that in consequence
of his sacredness he was subject to a great
number of restrictions. I have already spoken of these
restrictions or priestly taboos in my second lecture; and
as I believe that in the period we are now dealing with
they were little more than a survival, I shall not return to
them now. But of the outward insignia, which marked
off the priest as alone entitled to perform the essential
act of worship, the sacrifice, and which bring him out of
the region of the <i>profanum</i> into that of <i>sacrum</i>, I must
say a few words before going farther.</p>

<p>In historical times the actual slaying of the victim
was done by subordinates, <i>popae</i>, <i>victimarii</i>, etc.; but
there is no doubt whatever that it was originally the work
of the priest, for he seems at all times to have used one
gesture which is clearly symbolic of it,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> and there are
traces also of a practice of wearing the toga in such a
way as to leave the right arm free for the act.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> That
toga, or any other special robe worn by the priest, was
always in whole or part red or purple. The purple-edged
<i>toga praetexta</i> was worn both by priests and
magistrates, and by children under age; and I think
there is good reason to believe that in all these cases the
original idea was the same&mdash;that they took part, directly
or indirectly, as primary or secondary agents in sacrificial
acts. The Salii and the augurs wore the <i>trabea</i>, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
was of purple or red, or both; the flamines had a special
robe about the colour of which we are not informed, but
the Flaminica Dialis wore a purple garment called <i>rica</i>,
and a red veil called <i>flammeum</i>, which was also worn by
the bride in the religious ceremony of marriage. Whether
we are to see in this prevalence of red or purple any
symbolism of the shedding of blood in sacrifice I cannot
be sure, but the inference is a tempting one, and has been
put forward with confidence by some recent investigators.
It is worth noting that the Vestals, who did not sacrifice
animals, wore white only.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> If the red colour has anything
to do with blood-shedding, it is probably more
than merely symbolic; it may mean that the sacrificing
priest partakes of that life and strength which he passes
on to the god through the blood, that is the life, of the
victim.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">361</a></p>

<p>The Roman priests had also other insignia, of which
the original meaning is less evident. The Flamen Dialis,
and probably all the flamines, wore a cap with an olive-twig
fastened to the top of it; this is well shown in
the sculptures of the Ara Pacis of Augustus.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> The
flaminicae had a head-dress called <i>tutulus</i>, which consisted
in part, at least, of a purple fillet or ribbon. The
flamines, when actually sacrificing, wore a <i>galerus</i>, or
hood of some kind made of the skin of a victim, and
the Flamen Dialis in particular wore one made of the
skin of a white heifer sacrificed to Jupiter.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> In these
various ways all priests were outwardly shown to be
holy men, <i>sacerdotes</i>, marked off from the <i>profanum
vulgus</i>. Only for the pontifices we have no information
as to a special dress, just as we also have none as to
their inauguratio.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">364</a></p>

<p>Thus there is no question that the priests were chosen
and separated from the people in such a way as to meet
with the approval of the gods; and even the acolytes,
<i>camilli</i> and <i>camillae</i>, boys and girls who frequently
appear in sacrificial scenes on monuments, wore the <i>toga
praetexta</i>, and, in order to be acceptable, must be the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
children of living parents.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> This rule has lately been
the subject of a discussion by Dr. Frazer, on which he
has brought to bear, as usual, a great range of learning.
He regards the restriction not so much as a matter
of good omen, <i>i.e.</i> of freedom from contamination
by the death of a parent, but as pointing to a notion
that they were "fuller of life and therefore luckier than
orphans."<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> Whether or no this explanation is the
right one, it is quite consistent, as we shall see directly,
with the general idea of sacrifice at Rome, and the
learning by which it is supported is in any case of interest
and value.</p>

<p>There is abundant evidence from historical times that
all worshippers, and therefore <i>a fortiori</i> all priests, when
sacrificing, had to be personally clean and free from
every kind of taint; a rule which also held good for the
utensils used in the worship, which in many cases at least
were of primitive make and material, not such as were
in common use.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> The need of personal purity is well
expressed by Tibullus in his description of a rural
festival<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">368</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">vos quoque abesse procul iubeo, discedat ab aris</span>
<span class="i1">cui tulit hesterna gaudia nocte Venus.</span>
<span class="i0">casta placent superis: pura cum veste venite</span>
<span class="i1">et manibus puris sumite fontis aquam.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>These lines indicate an approach at least to the idea
of mental as well as material purity; and Cicero in his <i>ius
divinum</i> in the <i>de Legibus</i><a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> actually reaches that idea:
"caste iubet lex adire ad deos, animo videlicet, in quo
sunt omnia: nec tollit castimoniam corporis," etc. But
this is the language of a later age, and does not reflect
the notions of the old Roman, but rather those of the
religious philosophy of the Greek. The personal purity
which the Roman rule required was a survival from a
set of primitive ideas, closely connected with taboo,
which we are only now beginning to understand fully.
They are common to all or almost all peoples who have
made any progress in systematising their sacrificial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
worship. As Dr. Westermarck has recently expressed
it,<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> "they spring from the idea that the contact of a
polluting substance with anything holy is followed by
injurious consequences. It is supposed to deprive a
deity or holy being of its holiness.... So also a sacred
act is believed to lose its sacredness by being performed
by an unclean individual." And in the next sentence he
goes still farther back in the history of the belief, pointing
out that a polluting substance is itself held to contain
mysterious energy of a baneful kind. But I must leave
this interesting subject now; the story of the evolution
of the habit of cleanliness from these ancient ideas will
be found in the thirty-ninth chapter of his <i>Origin and
Development of Moral Ideas</i>.</p>

<p>Coming next to the act of sacrifice itself, it is needless
to say that the victim must be as exactly fitted to please
the deity&mdash;if that be the right way to express the
obligation&mdash;as the priest who sacrificed it. It must be
of the right kind, sex, age, colour; it must go willingly
to the slaughter, adorned with fillets and ribbons (<i>infulae</i>,
<i>vittae</i>), in order to mark it off from other animals as
holy; in the case of oxen, we hear also of the gilding
of the horns, but this must have been costly and unusual.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">371</a>
All these details were doubtless laid down in the <i>ius
divinum</i>, and in later times, when the deities dwelt in
roofed temples, they were embodied in the <i>lex</i> or charter
of each temple.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> I do not need to go into them here
minutely; for my present purpose, the elucidation of the
meaning which the Romans attached to sacrificial worship,
it will be sufficient to point out that all victims, so far
as we know, were domestic animals, and in almost all
cases they were valuable property (<i>pecunia</i>), such as
belonged to the stock of the Latin farmer, ox, sheep, pig,
varying according to age and sex. Goats were used at
the Lupercalia, and a horse was sacrificed to Mars, as we
have seen, on October 15, and at the Robigalia in April
a red dog was offered to the spirit of the mildew. But
though time forbids me to explain all these rules, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
careful study of the evidence for them is most useful
for any one who wishes to understand the influence of
the <i>ius divinum</i> on the mind of the early Roman. In
the family what rules were needed were matter of
tradition; deities were few, and offerings limited. But
in the city-state it was very different; here even the <i>di
indigetes</i> were many, with diverse wishes and likings as
well as functions: how were these to be ascertained and
remembered at the right moment? Here, as in all methods
of securing the <i>pax deorum</i>, a central supervising authority
was needed, in whose knowledge and wisdom the whole
community had confidence; and he was found in the rex,
as is clearly shown in the whole traditional account of the
priest-king Numa. Very naturally tradition also ascribed
to Numa the institution of the pontifices, whom the
historical Romans knew as succeeding the rex in the
supervision of religious law.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></p>

<p>If all went well, the victim going willingly and no ill
omen supervening, the actual slaughter followed at the
altar. During the whole operation silence was enjoined;
the priests' heads were veiled with the folds of the
toga;<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> pipers (<i>tibicines</i>) continued to play, in order
that no unlucky sound or word might be heard
which would make it necessary to start afresh with
another victim (<i>instauratio</i>). Immediately before the
slaughter the victim was made holier than ever by
sprinkling upon it fragments of sacred cake made of <i>far</i>
(<i>immolatio</i>), and by pouring on it libations of wine from
a <i>foculus</i> or movable altar containing this holy condiment,
together with incense if that were used in the rite. As
soon as it was dead, the internal organs were examined
to make sure that there was no physical defect or
abnormal growth, for it was, of course, quite as necessary
that the animal should be "purus" within as without;
this was the only object of the examination, until the
Etruscan art of <i>extipicina</i> made its way to Rome. What
became of the blood we are not told; I have already
remarked that blood has curiously little part in Roman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
ritual and custom.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> But the <i>exta</i>, <i>i.e.</i> internal organs of
life, were separated from the rest of the carcase, and
carefully cooked in holy vessels, before being laid upon
the altar (<i>porrectio</i>), together with certain slices of flesh
called <i>magmenta</i>, or increase-offerings, while the rest of
the flesh, which had now lost its holiness, was retained
for the use of the priests.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> The time occupied in
the actual slaughter and inspection of the organs was not
long; but the cooking of these must have been often a
lengthy process. Ovid tells us how on April 25 he met
the Flamen Quirinalis carrying out the exta of a dog and
a sheep, which had been sacrificed at Rome to Robigus
that morning, in order to lay them on the altar of that
deity at the fifth milestone on the Via Claudia.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> Certain
days in the calendar, called <i>endotercisi</i>, which were <i>nefasti</i>
in morning and evening, were <i>fasti</i> in the middle of the
day, between the slaying of a victim and the placing of
its exta on the altar (<i>inter hostiam caesam et exta porrecta</i>).<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">378</a></p>

<p>I have so far purposely omitted one important detail&mdash;the
prayer which, so far as we know, invariably
accompanied the sacrifice. It is not absolutely certain
at what moment of the rite it was said at Rome; in
the ritual of Iguvium we find it occurring immediately
before the placing of the exta on the altar;<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> but as that
ritual is a processional one, concerned with sacrifices at
several spots, the two chief parts of the rite, the slaughter
and the <i>porrectio</i>, probably followed closely on one
another. We may perhaps guess that where these two
parts were separated by a considerable interval, as in the
majority of Roman festivals, the prayer was said by the
priest also at the moment of <i>porrectio</i>. The prayer is
so important a detail as to need separate handling&mdash;important
because it helps us to interpret the ideas of
the Romans about their sacrifices, and the attitude in
which they conceived themselves as standing towards
the deities whom they thus approached. I propose to
occupy the rest of this lecture in considering this most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
interesting topic. I wish first to draw attention to a
particular feature, or rather expression, which occurs in
the authentic wording of certain prayers which we are
lucky enough to possess, because I think it throws some
light on the meaning which the Romans attached to the
sacrifice it accompanied; and secondly, to consider the
character of Roman prayers generally, in view of a
question now being largely discussed, <i>i.e.</i> whether prayer
is a development from spell or charm, belonging in its
origin to the region of magic.</p>

<p>We have various forms of prayer surviving in Roman
literature: some of them are versified by the poets, and
therefore give us a general impression of the contents
without the actual and genuine wording; we have also
two fragments of ancient <i>carmina</i> which have the form
of prayers, those of the Salii and the Fratres Arvales;
and we have certain forms used on special occasions, such
as the <i>evocatio</i> of the gods of a hostile community, or the
formulae of vows (<i>vota</i>) which I must postpone to the
next lecture. But the only unquestionably genuine old
Roman prayers used at sacrifice, taken from the books of
the pontifices and preserved word for word, are those
which Cato embodied in his treatise on agriculture in
the second century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, as proper to be used with sacrifice
on certain occasions in the agricultural year.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> It
is here that we meet with the phrase, familiar in another
form to all Latin scholars, on which I wish to lay stress
now. It occurs in all the four forms of prayer which
Cato copied down. The first is at the time of the flowering
of the pear-trees, on behalf of the oxen: "Iuppiter
dapalis, quod tibi fieri oportet in domo familia mea
culignam vini dapi eius rei<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> ergo, <i>macte hac illace dape
polucenda esto</i>." And again, when the wine is offered:
"Iuppiter dapalis, <i>macte istace dape polucenda esto. Macte
vino inferio esto</i>." So in the piacular sacrifice when a
clearing is made, the unknown deity is addressed in the
last words of the prayer thus: "harum rerum ergo <i>macte
hoc porco piaculo immolando esto</i>." We find this <i>macte esto</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
again in the prayer for the ceremony of lustratio, at the
end of the formula: "<i>macte hisce suovetaurilibus lactentibus
immolandis esto</i>." In the rite of the <i>porca praecidanea</i>,
to which I have already referred, the instruction for
the invocation of Jupiter runs: "<i>Fertum</i> (<i>i.e.</i> a kind of
cake) <i>Iovi obmoveto et mactato sic, Iuppiter, te hoc ferto</i>
obmovendo bonas preces precor, uti sies volens propitius
mihi liberisque meis domo familiaeque meae <i>mactus hoc
ferto</i>." Janus gets another kind of cake (<i>strues</i>) and a
wine-offering, and is addressed in the same way. Then
we read, "Iovi fertum obmoveto <i>mactatoque item</i>, ut
prius feceris."</p>

<p>What is the real meaning of this phrase <i>macte esto</i>,
which must surely have been in universal use at sacrifices,
not only at private rites like those of Cato, since it came
to be used in common speech of congratulation or felicitation,
e.g. <i>macte virtute esto</i>?<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> Servius in commenting
on Virgil has made it sufficiently clear. He explains it
as <i>magis aucte</i>, and connects it with <i>magmentum</i>, increase-offering,
<i>quasi magis augmentum</i>, and adds that when
the victims had been slain and their exta placed on the
altar, they were said to be <i>mactatae</i>. So, too, in another
comment he seems to connect the word with the victim
rather than with the deity. But he is quite clear as to
the meaning of the word, as signifying an increase or
addition of some kind; and though his etymology is wrong,
we may be sure that he was right in this respect, for it is
beyond doubt built on a base, <i>mac</i> or <i>mag</i>, which produced
<i>magnus</i>, <i>maius</i>, <i>maiestas</i>, and so on. "Macte nova virtute
puer" means "Be thou increased, strengthened in <i>virtus</i>";
a fragment of Lucilius (quoted by Servius) brings this
out well, "<i>Macte inquam virtute simulque his viribus
esto</i>," and another from Ennius, "Livius inde redit magno
<i>mactatus</i> triumpho."<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> We might almost translate it in
these passages by "glorified"; but it most certainly
includes the meaning of "strengthened" or "increased
in might."</p>

<p>Now in the formulae of Cato we have seen that it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
applied to the deity and not to the victim; this naturally
did not occur to Servius, whose mind was occupied rather
with Virgil and the literary use of the word than with the
original use and meaning of the language of prayer. Undoubtedly
he has made a mistake here, which Cato's piety
has enabled us to detect. It was, in fact, the deity whose
strength was to be increased by the offerings; so much
at least seems to me to be beyond doubt. There is,
indeed, no certain trace in the ritual, or in Roman literature,
that the gods were supposed to consume the exta,
or the cakes and wine offered them; that primitive
notion must have been excluded from the <i>ius divinum</i>.
But instead of it we find the more spiritual idea that by
placing on the altar the organs of the life of the victim,
with ancient forms of sacred cake and offerings of wine,
the vitality of the deity, his power to help his worshippers,
to make the corn grow and the cattle bring forth
young, to aid the State against enemies, or what not, was
really increased in this semi-mystic way. Let us remember
that the Roman numina were powers constantly at
work in their own sphere; they are the various manifestations
of the one Power as conceived in immediate relation
to man and his wants; they are sometimes addressed in
prayer, as we have seen, by additional titles which suggest
their strength and vitality: Virites Quirini, Nerio Martis,
Moles Martis, Maia or Maiestas Volcani. What, then,
could be more natural than that the Roman should call upon
his divine fellow-citizen to accept that which, according
to ancient tradition and practice, will keep up his strength,
and at the same time increase his glory and his goodwill
towards his worshippers? This is, then, the idea which I
believe to have been at the root of Roman sacrificial
ritual, and it seems to confirm the dynamic theory of
sacrifice recently propounded by some French anthropologists,
<i>i.e.</i> that a mystic current of <i>religious force</i>
passed through the victim, from priest to deity, and
perhaps back again.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> I believe that we have here a
transitional idea of the virtue of sacrifice&mdash;an idea that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
bridges over the gulf between the crude notion that the
gods actually partake of the offering, and the later more
spiritual view that the offering is an honorary gift "to the
glory of God." It seems also to be found in the Vedic
religion. Dr. Farnell writes: "In the Vedic ritual we
find a pure and spiritual form of prayer; yet a certain
spell-power may attach even to the highest types, for we
find not infrequently the conception that not only the
power of the worshipper, but the power of the deity also
is nourished and strengthened by prayer, and the prayer
itself is usually accompanied by a potent act (such as that
of sacrifice). "May our prayers increase Agni": "The
prayers fill thee with power and strengthen thee, like
great rivers the Sindhu."<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<p>I must now turn to the form and manner of Roman
prayers, in order to gain further light on the question as
to the mental attitude of the worshipper towards the
deity invoked. Of late years there has been a strong
tendency to find the origin of prayer in spell; or, in other
words, to discover a bridge between that mental attitude
which believes that a deity can be forced into a certain
course of action by magical formulae, and the humble
attitude of the petitioner in prayer, which assumes that
the power of the deity altogether transcends that of his
worshipper. The evidence of Roman prayers is, I think,
of considerable value in dealing with this question; but
it needs to be carefully studied and handled. The general
impression conveyed by those who have written on the
subject is that Roman prayers were dull, dry formulae,
which were believed to have a constraining influence on
the deity simply as formulae, if they were repeated with
perfect precision the right number of times. Dr. Westermarck,
for example, has no shadow of a doubt about this;
quoting Renan, he says that "in the Roman, as in the
majority of the old Italian cults, prayer is a magic
formula, producing its effect by its own inherent quality."
And again, he writes that the Romans were much more
addicted to magic than to religion; "they wanted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
compel the gods rather than to be compelled by them.
Their <i>religio</i> was probably near akin to the Greek &#954;&#945;&#964;&#7937;&#948;&#949;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#987;,
which meant not only an ordinary tie, but also a magic
tie or knot or a bewitching thereby."<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> I need not stop to
point out the misconception of the word <i>religio</i> which
suggested the whole of this passage; the supposed derivation
from <i>ligare</i> was quite enough to suggest magic to
those who are on the trail of it.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> Let us go on to
examine the prayers themselves; I think we shall find
that though there is much truth in the common view of
them, it is not quite the whole truth.</p>

<p>The oldest Roman prayers we possess are usually
called hymns, because the Latin word for them was
<i>carmen</i>, viz. the <i>Carmen Saliare</i>, which is too obscure
and fragmentary to be of use to us, and the <i>Carmen</i> of
the Arval Brethren, which is preserved on stone and is
quite intelligible.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> The word <i>carmen</i>, let us notice, was
used by the old Romans for any kind of metrical formula,
whether hymn, prayer, or spell. Pliny, when writing of
magic and incantations, plainly includes prayer among
them;<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> and Dr. Jevons has recently pointed out that
singing, and especially singing in a low voice or muttered
tones, is a characteristic of magic not only in Greece and
Rome, but in many parts of the world at the present day.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a>
The evidence of the word is thus strongly in favour of the
view that these ancient <i>carmina</i> of Roman worship were
really spells; and the <i>Carmen Arvalium</i> itself does not
contradict it. After an elaborate sacrificial ceremonial
the priests, using a written copy of the <i>carmen</i> (<i>libellis
acceptis</i>), danced in triple rhythm (<i>tripodaverunt</i>) while
they sang it; it consisted of six clauses, each repeated
three times. "<i>Enos Lases iuvate! Neve luerve Marmar
sins incurrere in pleores! Satur fu fere Mars, limen sali,
sta berber! Semunes alternei advocapit cunctos! Enos
Marmar iuvato! Triumpe!</i>" With the precise interpretation
of these words I am not now concerned; but
they obviously contain invocations to the Lares and Mars,
which may be either petitions or commands, and which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
perhaps are really on the borderland between the two; and
as thrice repeated, and accompanied with dancing and
gesticulation, they seem certainly to belong rather to the
region of magic than of religion proper.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare with this <i>carmen</i> the
prayers of the guild of brethren (<i>Attiedii</i>) at Iguvium;
these are the best preserved of all old Italian prayers,
and though not Roman, are the product of the same race.
In the lustratio of the <i>arx</i> (<i>Ocris Fisius</i>) of Iguvium we
find three several deities invoked, with elaborate sacrificial
ritual, at three gates, and a long prayer addressed to each
deity, thrice repeated, as in the <i>Carmen Arvale</i>. It is to
be said under the breath (<i>tacitus precator totum</i>, vi. A. 55),
which was a common practice also at Rome, and is believed
to be characteristic of the magical spell;<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> and
except in the case of the first prayer, which is addressed
to the chief deity Jupiter Grabovius, it is accompanied
by some kind of dancing or rhythmical movement (<i>tripodatio</i>).<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a>
Thus in outward form this ritual seems to show
but little advance on the Roman prayer of the Arvales,
and indeed it may in substance go back to a time as
remote as that in which the latter had its origin. But
when we examine the matter of the prayer, we find that
it is cast in the language of petition beyond all doubt&mdash;if
it be rightly interpreted, as we may believe it is:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Te invocavi invoco divum Grabovium pro arce Fisia,
pro urbe Iguvina, pro arcis nomine, pro urbis nomine:
<i>volens sis, propitius sis</i> arci Fisiae, urbi Iguvinae, arcis

Grabovium. Sancti fiducia te invocavi invoco divum

Dive Grabovi, te hoc bove opimo piaculo pro arce Fisia,

Dive Grabovi, te invocavi."<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a></p>

<p>That in this prayer, and the others which accompany
it, exactness of wording was believed to be essential, as
in the ritual which preceded it exactness of performance,
there is no doubt; for at the end of the whole document
(vi. B. 48) we find that if there had been any slip in the
ritual, the Brethren had to go back to the first gate and
begin all over again. There is plainly present the idea,
surviving from an age of magic, that the deities had strong
feelings about the right way of invocation, and would not
respond to the performance unless those feelings were
understood and appealed to; that they would miss something
and decline to do their part. Yet are we justified
in going on to assume that they were bound, as by a
solemn contract, to perform their part, if there were no
slip in the ritual? I confess it is difficult for me to take
this further step, in view of the language of the prayers,
which is so clearly that of petition, nay, of humble petition.
We are not dealing here with <i>vota</i>, to which I shall come
in the next lecture, and in which there is a kind of legal
contract between the man and the god&mdash;the former
undertaking to do something pleasing to the deity, if the
latter shall have faithfully performed what is asked of him.
These <i>vota</i>, so abundant in historical times, are really
responsible for the idea that Roman prayer is simply a
binding formula&mdash;a magical spell, let us say, which in
the hands of a city priesthood has become a quasi-legal
formula. But these prayers are not <i>vota</i>; they do not
contain any language which betrays the notion of binding
the deity. They seem to me to mark a process of transition
between the age of spell and magic and the age<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
of prayer and religion; they retain some of the outward
characteristics of spell, but internally, <i>i.e.</i> in the
spirit in which they were intended, they have the real
characteristics of prayer.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> The numina to whom
they were addressed were powerful spirits, unknown,
unfamiliar, until their wishes were discovered by the
organised priesthood which handed down these forms of
petition.</p>

<p>To return to Rome, and to the prayers in Cato's book,
to which I referred just now when discussing the word
<i>macte</i>. Attempts have been made to prove that these
were originally written in metre;<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> and this is quite possible.
If so, it only means that they retained the outward form
of the primitive spell; it must not lead us on to fancy
that the sacrifice which accompanied the prayer was a
magical act, or that the whole process was believed to
compel the deity. No doubt there was believed to be
efficacy in the exact repetition, as is shown by the
directions for piacular sacrifices in case of error of any
kind.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> But the language is the language of prayer, not
of compulsion, nor even of bargaining: "Eius rei ergo
te hoc porco piaculo immolando bonas preces precor, ut sies
volens propitius mihi, domo familiaeque meis."<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> "Mars
pater, te precor quaesoque uti sies volens propitius mihi,
domo," etc.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> No amount of vain repetition or scruple
can deprive this language of its natural meaning. The
god is powerful in his own sphere of action, and man has
no control over him; man is fully recognised as liable to
misfortune unless the god helps him; but he can worship
in full assurance of faith that his prayer will be answered,
if it be such as the authorities of the State have laid down
as the right wording, and if the ritual accompanying it is
equally in order. The faith is, indeed, thus founded upon
man's devices rather than the god's good-will as such; it
is a belief in the State and its authorities and <i>ius divinum</i>,
which is conceived, not indeed as constraining the deity,
but as calling upon him (<i>invocare</i>) to perform his part, in
formulae which he cannot well neglect, simply because it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
would be unreasonable to do so, contrary to his nature as
a deity of the Roman State and its <i>ager</i>.</p>

<p>It is obvious in all this sacrificial ritual that the officiating
person or persons were expected to observe the
traditional forms with the utmost care and exactness.
Any slip or omission was, in fact, a <i>piaculum</i>, or <i>sacrum
commissum</i>&mdash;terms of the <i>ius divinum</i> which seem to
suggest, if I may use the expression, the obverse side of
holiness. It is now well known that cleanness and uncleanness,
holiness and its opposite, can be expressed in
religious vocabulary by the same terms, for in both cases
there is something beyond the ordinary, something
dangerous, uncanny; thus we are not surprised to find
that such words as I have just mentioned can be used to
express some kind of impurity caused by a breach of
ritual as well as that ritual itself. If we accept the latest
theory of sacrifice, <i>i.e.</i> the dynamic theory, as it is called,
we explain this intense nervousness about a ritualistic
flaw as occasioned by the consciousness of a breach in
the current of "religious force" (the expression is that of
Messrs. Hubert and Mauss<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a>), which must pass in regular
sequence from the sacrificer through the victim to the
deity, or vice versa. If this is the true explanation&mdash;and
at present it may be said to hold the field&mdash;then the
extreme exactness of the Roman ritual was a survival
from an age when this strange feeling was a reality; but
no more than a survival, for, so far as I can discover, the
Roman idea was rather that the deity to whom the ritual
was addressed was in some way offended by the omission.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">400</a>
The dynamic notion is lost, if it ever were there,
and its place has been taken by one that we may perhaps
call theological. But however that may be, the culprit
was regarded as in a state of sin or impurity, "un &ecirc;tre
sacr&eacute;," and had to get rid of this sin or impurity by
another sacrifice before the whole ritual could be started
afresh (<i>instaurare</i>).</p>

<p>According to the "dynamic" theory of sacrifice, we
might naturally expect that the victim, as being destined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
to carry away the unholiness (or whatever we choose to
call it) of the culprit, would be burnt whole, not offered
to the deity in the form of exta, or eaten by the sacrificers.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">401</a>
But this does not seem to have been the case in
the Roman practice; in all the examples of <i>piacula</i> of
which we have details, the exta are laid on the altar as in
the typical sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> The inference seems to be that the
theological idea of sacrifice had established itself completely
ever since the formation of the <i>ius divinum</i>; the
victim is not a scapegoat in any sense, but really an
expiatory offering; and not only does the sacrificer yield
up something of value, but he offers it to increase the
strength of the deity as well as to appease his anger.</p>

<p>A curious point may be noticed in the last place.
The practical Roman mind seems to have invented a
kind of sacrificial insurance, by which a piacular sacrifice
might be offered beforehand to atone for any omission in
the ritual which was to follow. Thus the Fratres Arvales,
if they had to take an iron implement into their sacred
grove, offered a piaculum before as well as after this
breach of religious rule.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> Again, the <i>porca praecidanea</i>,
which I have already mentioned as offered before harvest,
was an example of the same system of insurance; for the
first cutting of the corn was a sacred rite, and one in
which it was easy to take a false step. Writing of this,
Gellius says in general terms that <i>hostiae praecidaneae</i> are
those which are offered the day before <i>sacrificia solennia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a></p>

<p>The term "piacular sacrifice" (<i>piaculum</i>) had a wide
range of meaning, apart from the examples here given.
With one important form of it I shall deal in the next
lecture:<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> others we shall come across later on.</p>

deity was unknown, the <i>ius</i> of the religious act was also uncertain,
<i>i.e.</i> the ritual was not laid down. De Marchi translates (<i>La Religione</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
<i>nella vita domestica</i>, i. 132) "sia a te fatto il debito sacrificio," etc.,
which sufficiently expresses the anxiety of the situation. Keil reads
here "ut tibi ius <i>est</i>," and gives no variant in his critical note; but
the words just below, "uti id recte factum siet," seem to me to
suggest the subjunctive. In any case there is no doubt about
<i>ius</i>. In <i>Tab. Iguv.</i> vi. A. 28 (<i>Umbrica</i>, p. 58) Buecheler translates
the Umbrian <i>persei mersei</i> by "quicquid ius sit," and compares this
passage of Cato, together with Gellius i. 12. 14, where the phrase is
used of the duties of a Vestal under the <i>ius divinum</i> in the formula
used by the Pontifex Maximus, <i>cum virginem capiat</i>: "Sacerdotem
Vestalem, quae sacra faciat, quae ius siet sacerdotem Vestalem facere
pro pop. Rom." etc.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_347_347" id="Footnote_347_347"></a><a href="#FNanchor_347_347"><span class="label">347</span></a> This follows from the definition in Festus, p. 321, and in
Macrobius iii. 3. 2. This last is quoted from Trebatius <i>de religionibus</i>:
"sacrum est quicquid est quod deorum habetur." In common
use <i>sacrificium</i> seems to be reserved for animal sacrifice, but the verb
<i>sacrificare</i> is not so limited. Festus, p. 319: "mustum quod Libero
sacrificabant pro vineis ... sicut praemetium de spicis, quas primum
messuissent, sacrificabant Cereri." It has been suggested to me by
Mr. Marett that the termination of the word <i>sacrificium</i> may have
reference to the use of <i>facere</i> for animal sacrifice, as in Greek &#8165;&#7953;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;,
&#7956;&#961;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#957;, &#948;&#961;&#8118;&#957;; but on the whole I doubt this. <i>Facere</i> and <i>fieri</i> are in
that sense, I think, euphemisms, occasioned by the mystic character
of the act (examples are collected in Brissonius <i>de formulis</i>, p. 9).
<i>Rem divinam facere</i> seems to be the general expression, as in Cato,
<i>R.R.</i> 83; or the particular victim is in the ablative, <i>e.g. agna Iovi
facit</i> (Flamen Dialis) in Varro, <i>L.L.</i> vi. 16; cp. Virg. <i>Ecl.</i> iii. 77.</p></div>

in <i>Encycl. Brit.</i>, ed. 10, has lately been criticised by Hubert et
Mauss, in <i>M&eacute;langes d'histoire des religions</i>, p. 9 foll.; but it is
sufficiently complete for our purposes. At the same time it is well to
be aware that no classification of the various forms of sacrifice can
be complete at present; that which these authors prefer, <i>i.e.</i> constant
and occasional sacrifices, is, however, a useful one.</p></div>

found at the Parilia (<i>R.F.</i> p. 81, and Ovid, <i>Fasti</i>, iv. 743 foll.) and
Terminalia (Ovid, <i>Fasti</i>, ii. 657); but in both cases Ovid seems to be
describing rustic rites; nor is it certain that the meal was really
sacramental. What does seem proved is that the old Latins and
other Italians believed the deities of the house to be present at their
meals&mdash;

and thus the idea was maintained that in some sense all meals had a
sacred character, <i>i.e.</i> all in which the members of a <i>familia</i> (see
above, p. 78), or of <i>gens</i> or <i>curia</i>, met together. Cp. R. Smith, <i>op. cit.</i>
p. 261 foll. We may remember that the Penates were the spirits of
the food itself, not merely of the place in which it was stored; it had
therefore a sacred character, which is also shown by the sanctification
of the firstfruits (<i>R.F.</i> pp. 151, 195). (The <i>cenae collegiorum</i>,
dinners of collegia of priests, were in no sense sacrificial meals; see
Marquardt, p. 231, note 7; Henzen, <i>Acta Fratr. Arv.</i> pp. 13, 39, 40.)</p></div>

There is no doubt about the inauguratio of the three great flamines and
the rex sacrorum, who were all specially concerned with sacrifice, and
of the augurs, who would obviously need it in order to perform the
same ceremony for others&mdash;as a bishop needs consecration for the
same reason. As regards the pontifices, Dionysius (ii. 73. 3) clearly
thought it was needed for them, and we might a priori assume that
one who might become a pontifex maximus would need it; but
Wissowa discounts Dionysius' opinion, and I am unwilling to differ
from him on a point of the <i>ius divinum</i>, of which he is our best
exponent. If he is right, it may be that the three <i>flamines maiores</i>,
who were reckoned in strict religious sense as above the pontifices,
including their head (Festus, p. 185), needed "holiness" more than
any pontifex, and so with the augurs. The insignia of the pontifices,
as well as many historical facts, show that the pontifices were competent
to perform sacrifice in a general sense (Marq. p. 248 foll.); but it is
possible that they never had the right, like the flamines, actually to
slay the victim. I do not feel sure that the <i>securis</i> was really one of
their symbols, though Horace seems to say so in <i>Ode</i> iii. 23. 12. The
whole question needs further investigation. It may be found that
the essential distinction between the pontifices and magistrates <i>cum
imperio</i> on the one hand, and the flamines on the other, is to be
sought in the ideas of holiness connected with the shedding of
blood in sacrifice. The flamen is permanently holy, having charge
of constant sacrifices; <i>e.g.</i> the Dialis had duties every day. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
is the duly sanctified guide for all rites within his own religious
range.</p></div>

explanation referred to, see Samter, <i>Familienfeste</i>, p. 40 foll.; Diels,
<i>Sibyllinische Bl&auml;tter</i>, p. 70; and cp. von Duhn's paper, "Rot und
Tot" in <i>Archiv</i>, 1906, p. 1 foll. That red colouring was used in
various ways in sacred and quasi-sacred rites there is no doubt (see
above, p. 89, note 46); but whether it can be always connected with
bloodshed is by no means so certain (Rohde, <i>Psyche</i>, i. 226). In the
case of women it is at least hard to understand. The idea of consecration
through blood, which is very rare in Roman literature, comes out
curiously in the words which Livy puts into the mouth of Virginius
after the slaughter of his daughter (iii. 48): "Te Appi tuumque
caput sanguine hoc consecro" (<i>i.e.</i> to a deity not mentioned).
The sentence to which this note refers was written before
the appearance of Messrs. Hubert et Mauss' essay on sacrifice
(<i>M&eacute;langes d'histoire des religions</i>, pp. 1-122). The theory there
developed, that the victim is the intermediary in all cases between the
sacrificer and the deity, and that the <i>force religieuse</i> passes from
one to the other in one direction or another, does not essentially differ
from the words in the text; but the French savants would, I imagine,
prefer to look on the insignia in a general sense as bringing the person
wearing them within the region of the <i>sacrum</i>, the force of which
would react on him still more strongly after the destruction of the
victim (see p. 28 foll.).</p></div>

Varro held (<i>L.L.</i> v. 83) and as the majority of scholars believe (see
O. Gilbert, <i>Rom. Topographie</i>, ii. 220, note), the difficulty remains
that they are found in such a city as Praeneste, where there was no
river to be bridged, and where they could not well have been merely
an offshoot from the Roman college; see Wissowa, <i>R.K.</i> p. 432, note.

<i>aperto capite</i> of the <i>Graecus ritus</i>) is usually explained as meant to
shut out all sounds belonging to the world of the <i>profanum</i>; and
the playing of the tibicines is interpreted in the same way. Hubert
et Mauss explain the covered head differently: "le rituel romain
prescrivit g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement l'usage du voile, signe de s&eacute;paration et
partant de cons&eacute;cration" (p. 28). Miss Harrison, <i>Prolegomena to</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
<i>the Study of Greek Religion</i>, p. 522, also holds that it is the outward
sign of consecration; cp. S. Reinach, <i>Cultes, mythes, et religions</i>, i.
300 foll. The fact, noted by Miss Harrison, that in Festus's
account of the <i>ver sacrum</i> (p. 379, ed. M&uuml;ller) the children expelled
were veiled, seems to point to the idea of dedication&mdash;unless, indeed,
<i>velabant</i> here means that they blindfolded them.</p></div>

which suggests a substitution for blood; Arnobius vii. 29 and 30;
Dion. Hal. vii. 72. I cannot find that any one of the many utensils
used in sacrifice were for pouring out blood. Blood was, however,
poured on the stone at the Terminalia (<i>R.F.</i> pp. 325-326); but the rite
here described by Ovid seems to be a rural one, outside the <i>ius
divinum</i>. In the sacrifice of victims to Hecate in Virg. <i>Aen.</i> vi.
243 foll., which cannot be <i>ritus Romanus</i>, the warm blood is collected
in <i>paterae</i>; but nothing is said of what was done with it, nor does
Servius help. Cp. <i>Aen.</i> viii. 106. In Lucretius v. 1202, "aras
sanguine multo spargere quadrupedum," the context shows that the
ritual alluded to is not old Roman. In Livy's description of the
"occulti paratus sacri" of the Samnites (ix. 41), we find "<i>respersae
fando nefandoque sanguine arae</i>, et dira exsecratio ac furiale carmen."
Livy seems to think of this blood-sprinkling, whether the blood be
human or animal, as unusual and horrible. Ancient, no doubt, is the
practice, recorded in the <i>Acta Fratr. Arv.</i> (see Henzen, pp. 21 and
23), of using the blood in a religious feast, in the process of cooking:
"porcilias piaculares epulati sunt et sanguem." (There is a mention
of the pouring of blood in an inscription from Lusitania in <i>C.I.L.</i> ii.
2395.) For the use of wine as a substitute for blood, see the
recently published work of Karl Kircher, "Die sakrale Bedeuting
des Weines," in <i>Religionsgeschichtliche Versuche, etc.</i>, p. 82 foll.,
where, however, the subject is not worked out.</p></div>

"quippe victimam caedi sine precatione non videtur referre aut deos

the prayer must be said while the priest's hand touches the altar,
one may guess that this was done at the same time that the exta
were laid on it. Ovid saw the priest at the Robigalia offer the exta
and say the prayer at the same time (<i>Fasti</i>, iv. 905 foll.), but does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>

neither had originally any direct reference to slaughter. The best
account I find of the word is in H. Nettleship's <i>Contributions to

a lost verb <i>maco</i> or <i>mago</i>, to make great, increase, equivalent to

powerful for evil as well as good, <i>e.g.</i> Robigus, the spirit of the red
mildew, and that the power of such a deity was not to be encouraged
or increased. But all such deities (and I cannot mention another
besides Robigus) were of course conceived as able to restrain their
own harmful function; they were not invoked to go away and leave
the ager Romanus in peace, but to limit their activity in the land
where they had been settled for worship. We have no prayer to
Robigus (or Robigo, feminine, as Ovid has it) except that which
Ovid somewhat fancifully versified after hearing the Flamen
Quirinalis say it (<i>Fasti</i>, iv. 911 foll.), in which of course the word
<i>macte</i> does not occur. As the victim was a dog, an uneatable one,
it is possible that the ritual was not quite the usual one. But the
language of the prayer is interesting and brings out my point:
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">aspera Robigo, parcas Cerialibus herbis.</span>
<span class="i1">vis tua non levis est;...</span>
<span class="i0">parce precor, scabrasque manus a messibus aufer</span>
<span class="i1">neve noce cultis: posse nocere sat est.</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>
It concludes by praying Robigo to direct her strength and attention
to other objects, <i>gladios et tela nocentia</i>; but this is the poet's
fancy.</p></div>

priestly routine and quasi-legal formulae. With this opinion I am
strongly inclined to agree. Cp. the story of Scipio Aemilianus

<h4>LECTURE IX</h4>

<h5>RITUAL&mdash;<i>continued</i></h5>


<p>In the last lecture we found that the magical element in
the Roman ritual is exaggerated by recent writers. But
it has also long been the practice to describe that ritual
as a system of bargaining with the gods: as partaking of
the nature of a legal contract. "The old Roman worship
was businesslike and utilitarian. The gods were partners
in a contract with their worshippers, and the ritual was
characterised by the hard formalism of the legal system of
Rome. The worshipper performed his part to the letter
with the scrupulous exactness required in pleadings before
the praetor."<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> This is an excellent statement of a view
very generally held, especially since Mommsen, whose
training in Roman law made him apt to dwell on the
legal aspects of Roman life, wrote the famous chapter in
the first volume of his history. I now wish to examine
this view briefly.</p>

<p>No doubt it was suggested by the necessary familiarity
of the Roman historian with <i>vota publica</i>, the vows so
frequently made on behalf of the State by its magistrates,
in terms supplied by the pontifices, and dictated by them
to the magistrate undertaking the duty. Some few of
these formulae have survived, and it may certainly be said
of them that they are analogous to legal formulae, and
express the quasi-contractual nature of the process. Such
legalised religious contracts seem to be peculiar to Rome;
they are curiously characteristic of the Roman genius for
formularisation, which in course of time had most important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
effects in the domain of civil law. But the vow as such
is, of course, by no means peculiar to Rome; it is familiar
in Greek history, and is found in an elementary form
among savages at the present day.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> But at Rome both
in public and private life it is far more frequent and
striking than elsewhere. This is a phenomenon that calls
for careful study; and we must beware that we are not
misled by quasi-legal developments into missing the real
significance of it from the point of view of morality and
religion.</p>

<p>The <i>vota privata</i>, which include vows and offerings
made to deities by private individuals, had never been
adequately examined till De Marchi wrote his book on
the private religion of the Romans; nor could they have
been so examined until the <i>Corpus Inscriptionum</i> was
fairly well advanced. There the material is extraordinarily
abundant, but it is, of course, almost entirely of
comparatively late date, and the great majority of votive
inscriptions belong to the period of the Empire. Yet it
is quite legitimate to argue from this to an origin of this
form of worship in the earliest times, and we have enough
early evidence to justify the inference. Among the oldest
Latin inscriptions are some found on objects such as cups
or vases, showing that the latter were votive offerings to a
deity: thus we have <i>Saeturni poculum, Kerri poculum</i>, and
other similar ones which will be found at the beginning of
the first volume of the <i>Corpus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> They give only the
name of the deity as a rule, and do not tell us why the
object was offered to him; but they must have been
thank-offerings for some supposed blessing. In one case,
not indeed at Rome, but not far away at Praeneste, we
have proof of this; for a mother makes a dedication to
Fortuna <i>nationu cratia</i>, which plainly expresses gratitude
for good luck in childbirth;<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> and this inscription is one of
the oldest we possess. Nor do they tell us whether there
was a previous vow or promise of which the offering is the
fulfilment. But in the majority of inscriptions of late date
the familiar letters V.S.L.M. (<i>votum solvit lubens merito</i>)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
betray the nature of the transaction, and it is not unreasonable
to guess that there was usually a previous undertaking
of some kind, to be carried out if the deity were gracious.</p>

<p>But these private <i>vota</i> were not, strictly speaking, legal
transactions, supposed to bind both parties in a contract,
as we shall see was to some extent the case with the <i>vota
publica</i>. They could not have needed the aid of a pontifex,
or a solemn <i>voti nuncupatio</i>, <i>i.e.</i> statement of the promise;
they were rather, as De Marchi asserts,<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> spontaneous
expressions of what we may call religious feeling; and it
may be that he is right in maintaining that throughout
Roman history they remained as expressions of the
religious sense and of the better feeling of the lower
classes. The practice implies three conceptions: (1) of
the deity as really powerful for good and evil; (2) of the
gift, a work of supererogation, as likely to please him;
(3) of the grateful act and feeling as good in themselves.
Surely there must have been in this practice a germ of
moral development; I am surprised that Dr. Westermarck
has not mentioned in his chapter on gratitude the extraordinary
abundance of Roman votive offerings and inscriptions.
Doubtless there lies at the root of it the idea of
<i>Do ut des</i>, or rather of <i>Dabo ut des</i>; doubtless also it
could be turned to evil purposes in the form of <i>devotio</i>,
when promises were made to a deity on condition that he
killed or injured an enemy; but in the ordinary and
common example it is impossible to deny that the final
act, the performance of the vow, must have been accompanied
by a feeling of gratitude. The merest recognition
of a supposed blessing is of value in moral development.</p>

<p>But it is in the <i>vota publica</i> that we undoubtedly find
something in the nature of a bargain&mdash;covenant would be
a more graceful word&mdash;with a deity in the name of the
State. Even here, however, the impression is rather produced
by the use of legal terms and the formularisation of
the process, than by any assumed attitude of contempt
towards, or even of equality with, the deity concerned.
There is no trace in early Roman religious history of any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
tendency to abuse or degrade the divine beings if they
did not perform their part, such as is well known in
China,<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> or even, strange to say, occasionally met with in
the southern Italy of to-day; the attitude towards the
deity in cult (though not invariably in the later Graeco-Roman
literature) was ever respectful, as it was towards
the magistrates of the State. The farthest the Romans
ever went in condemning their gods was when misfortune
persuaded them that they were become indifferent or useless;
then they began to neglect them, and to turn to
other gods, as we shall see in subsequent lectures.</p>

<p>The public <i>vota</i> were of two kinds: the ordinary, or
regularly recurring, and the extraordinary, which were
occasioned by some particular event. Of the ordinary,
the most familiar is that undertaken by the consul, and no
doubt in some form by the Rex in the days of the kingship,
for the benefit of the State on the first day of the official
year. Accompanied by the Senate and a crowd of people,
the consuls went up to the Capitoline temple, and performed
the sacrifice which had been vowed by their predecessors
of a year before; after which they undertook a new
<i>votum</i>, "<i>pro reipublicae salute</i>."<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> We have not the
formula of this vow, and cannot tell what resemblance it
bore to a bargain; but the ceremony itself must have been
most impressive, and calculated to remind all who were
present of the greatness and goodwill of the supreme
deity who watched over the interests of the State. So
too at the <i>lustrum</i> of the censors, which took place in the
Campus Martius every five years, it is almost certain that
the <i>votum</i> of the predecessors in office was fulfilled by a
sacrifice, and a new one undertaken. Here again we are
without the formula, but that there was one we know from
a very interesting passage of Valerius Maximus. He tells
us that Scipio Aemilianus, when as censor he was conducting
this sacrifice, and the <i>scriba</i> (on behalf of the pontifex?)
was dictating to him the <i>solemne precationis carmen ex
publicis tabulis</i>, in which the immortal gods were besought
to make the prosperity of the Roman State "better and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
greater," had the audacity to interrupt him, saying that
the condition of the State was sufficiently good and great:
"itaque precor ut eas (res) perpetuo incolumes servent."
This change, Valerius says, was accepted, and the formula
altered accordingly in the <i>tabulae</i>.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> This story, which is
probably genuine and is quite characteristic of Scipio,
must convince an impartial mind that in this votive ceremony
there was enough truth and dignity to suggest a
real advance in religious thought, so far at least as the
State was concerned.</p>

<p>The extraordinary <i>vota</i> were innumerable. They were
occasioned by dangers or misfortunes of various kinds, the
magistrate undertaking to dedicate something to the god
concerned if the State should have come safely through
the peril. Many temples had their origin in this practice;<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">414</a>
we meet also with <i>ludi</i>, special sacrifices, or a tithe of the
booty taken in war. In two or three cases Livy has
copied the formula from the <i>tabulae</i> of the pontifices;
thus before the war with Antiochus in 191 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the
consul recited the following words after the pontifex
maximus: "Si duellum quod cum Antiocho rege sumi
populus iussit, id ex sententia senatus populique Romani
confectum erit; tum tibi Iuppiter populus Romanus ludos
magnos dies decem continuos faciet ... quisquis magistratus
eos ludos quando ubique faxit, hi ludi recte facti,
donaque data recte sunto."<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> This document dates from
the days of the decay of the Roman religion, and is, of
course, modernised by Livy; but it may give an idea of
what is meant by writers who speak of an element of
bargain or covenant in these <i>vota</i>. Still more elaborate,
and probably more antique, is the famous formula of the
vow of the <i>ver sacrum</i> in the darkest hour of the war with
Hannibal.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> This very curious rite, which proves beyond
question the devotion of the Italian stocks to the principle
of the <i>votum</i>, consisted of a promise to dedicate to Mars
or Jupiter all the valuable products of a single spring,
including the male children born at that time; to this the
Romans had recourse for the last time in 217 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Livy has fortunately preserved the words of the vow.
These, with the exception of the dedication of the children,
which is judiciously omitted, probably stand much as they
had come down from a remote antiquity. The <i>votum</i> is put
in the form of a <i>rogatio</i> to the people, without whose
sanction it could not be put in force; are they willing to
dedicate to Jupiter all the young of oxen, sheep, or pigs
born in the spring five years after date, if the State shall
have been preserved during those years from all its
enemies? The curious feature of the document is, not
that it binds the deity to any course of action, but that it
secures the individual Roman against his anger in case of
any chance slip in his part of the process, and the people
against any evil consequences arising from such a slip or
from misdoing on the part of an individual. "Si quis
clepsit, ne populo scelus esto neve cui cleptum erit: si atro
die faxit insciens, probe factum esto."<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> Of this formula
a recent writer of great learning and ability has written
thus: "The well-known liturgical archive containing
Rome's address to Jupiter in the critical days of the Hannibalic
war is a wary and cleverly drawn legal document,
intended to bind the god as well as the State."<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> He is
no exception to the rule that those who have not habitually
occupied themselves with the Roman religion are
liable to misinterpret its details. This is not an address
to Jupiter, nor is there any sign in it that the god was
considered as bound to perform his part as in a contract;
the covenant is a one-sided one, the people undertaking
an act of self-renunciation if the god be gracious to them,
and thereby going far to assure themselves that he will so
be gracious. And the legal cast of the language, which
seems so apt to mislead the unwary,<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> is only to be found
in the clauses which guarantee the people against the contingency
of the whole vow being ruined by the inadvertence
or the rascality of an individual; surely a very
natural and inevitable <i>caveat</i>, where for once the whole
people, and not only their priests or magistrates, were
concerned in the transaction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p>A curious form of the <i>votum</i>, which, however, I can
only mention in passing, is that addressed to the gods of
a hostile city, with a view to induce them to desert their
temples and take up their abode at Rome; this is the
process called <i>evocatio</i>, which was successfully applied at
the siege of Veii, when Juno Regina consented to betray
her city.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> Macrobius, commenting on Virgil's lines
(<i>Aen.</i> ii. 351),</p>

<p>has preserved the <i>carmen</i> used at the siege of Carthage.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">421</a>
It is cast in the language of prayer: "Si deus si dea est
cui populus civitasque Carthaginiensis est in tutela ... precor
venerorque veniamque a vobis peto ut vos populum
civitatemque Carthaginiensem deseratis," etc.; but it ends
with a vow to build temples and establish <i>ludi</i> in honour
of these deities if they should comply with the petition.
It is worth noting here that it was, of course, impossible
to make a bargain with strange or hostile gods, or in any
way to force their hand; the promise is entirely one-sided;
and I am inclined to think that in dealing with his
own gods the mental attitude of the Roman was much the
same, though his faith in them was undoubtedly greater.</p>

<p>This is the proper place to mention another very
curious rite, closely allied to the <i>votum</i>, but differing
from it in one or two important points, which is almost
peculiar to the Romans and most characteristic of them;
I mean the <i>devotio</i> of himself on the field of battle by
a magistrate <i>cum imperio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> The famous example,
familiar to us all, is that of Decius Mus at the battle
of Vesuvius in the great Latin war<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> (340 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>): the
same story is told of his son in a war with Gauls and
Samnites, and of his grandson in the war with Pyrrhus.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">424</a>
The historical difficulties of these accounts do not concern
us now; by common consent of scholars the method and
formula of the <i>devotio</i> are authentic, and the rite must
have had its origin in remote antiquity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

<p>The story runs<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> that Decius, at whose preliminary
sacrifice before the battle with the Latins the liver of the
victim had been found imperfect, while that of his
colleague was normal, perceived that his wing of the
army was giving way. He therefore resolved to
sacrifice himself by <i>devotio</i>, and called on the pontifex
maximus, who was present, to dictate for him the correct
formula. He was directed to put on the toga praetexta,
to wear it with the cinctus Gabinus, to veil his head with
it, to touch his chin with his hand under the folds of
the robe, and to stand upon a spear. He then repeated
after the pontifex the following formula: "Iane, Iuppiter,
Mars pater, Quirine, Bellona, Lares, divi Novensiles, di
Indigetes, divi quorum est potestas nostrorum hostiumque,
diique Manes, vos precor, veneror, veniam peto feroque, uti
populo Romano Quiritium vim victoriamque prosperetis,
hostesque populi Romani Quiritium terrore formidine
morteque adficiatis. Sicut verbis nuncupavi, ita pro
re publica Quiritium, exercitu legionibus auxiliis populi
Romani Quiritium, legiones auxiliaque hostium <i>mecum</i>
deis Manibus Tellurique devoveo" (Livy ix. 9). He
then mounted his horse and rode into the midst of the
enemy to meet his death. The Latins were seized with
panic and the Romans were victorious.</p>

<p>Here the vow is made and fulfilled almost at the
same moment,&mdash;<i>the fulfilment takes place before the
gods have done their part</i>. Here too the offering made
is the life of a human being which brings the act within
the domain of sacrifice. Its sacrificial nature is obvious
in all the details.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> The dress is that of the sacrificing
priest or magistrate;<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> Decius was therefore priest and
victim at the same time, and the two characters seem
to be combined in the symbolic touching of the chin,
which has been rightly explained,<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> I think, as analogous
to the laying on of hands in the consecratio of the Rex,
as we saw it in the case of Numa, and perhaps to the
<i>immolatio</i> of a victim by sprinkling the <i>mola salsa</i> on
its head; where the object of consecration is made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
holy by contact with holy things.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> The standing on
the spear is difficult to explain; it may have been a
symbolic dedication to Mars, whose spear or spears, as
we have seen, were kept in the Regia.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">430</a></p>

<p>The formula contains certain points of great interest.
Firstly, it is not only the Roman gods of all sorts and
conditions who are invoked, but those of the enemy
also, or, in vague language, those who have power over
both Romans and Latins.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> Secondly, it begins with
a prayer combined with a curse upon the enemy: in
which respect it resembles the prayer at the <i>lustratio
populi</i> at Iguvium<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> (which I shall mention again directly)
and to a later type of <i>devotio</i> used at the siege of Carthage
and preserved by Macrobius.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> Thirdly, in spite of this
religious aspect of the formula, it ends with what can
only be called a magical spell. By the act of self-sacrifice,
which is the potent element in the spell, Decius
exercises magical power over the legions of the enemy,
and devotes them with himself to death,&mdash;to the Manes
and Mother Earth.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">434</a></p>

<p>The story suggests to me that the rite had been at
one time well known; the pontifex maximus was ready
with the instructions and formula. It was a survival
from an age of magic, but the priests have given it a
religious turn, and the language of the first part is quite
as much that of prayer as is the language of the collect
to be said in time of war which still disfigures the Anglican
prayer-book.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> What is still more remarkable is that it
has not only a religious but an ethical character. The
idea of service to the State is here seen at its highest
point. The sacrifice is a vicarious one.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> Livy significantly
adds that a private soldier might be chosen by
the commander to represent him, and that if this man
were not killed by the enemy an image seven feet long
must be buried in the earth and a piacular sacrifice
offered.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> Later on it would seem that instead of
sacrificing himself, the consul might implore the gods
to accept the hostile army or city as his substitutes: "eos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
<i>vicarios</i> pro me fide magistratuque meo pro populi
Romani exercitibus do devoveo, ut me exercitumque
nostrum ... bene salvos siritis esse."<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> The idea here,
and indeed in the <i>devotio</i> of Decius, bears some analogy
to that which lies at the root of the old Roman practice,
of making a criminal <i>sacer</i> to the deity chiefly concerned
in his crime; when this was done, any man might kill
him, and he was practically a victim offered as <i>vicarius</i>
for the Roman people, who had been contaminated by
his deed.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">439</a></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>But I must now pass on the last kind of ritual to be
explained in these lectures, and far the most impressive
of all, that of <i>lustratio</i>, or the purification, as it is
commonly called, of land, city, human beings, or even
inanimate objects, by means of a solemn procession
accompanied with sacrifice.</p>

<p>So important a part did these processional rites play
in the public life of the Roman people,&mdash;so characteristic
are they too of the old Roman habit of thought and
action, that they have given a wonderful word to the
Latin language. <i>Lustrare</i> has many meanings; but
the one which is immediately derived from the rites I
speak of, that of slow processional movement, is the
most beautiful and impressive of them all. When
Aeneas first sees Dido in all her stately beauty, he
says:<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">440</a></p>

<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>

<p>"So long as the cloud-shadows move slowly over the
hollows of the hills." Here in Scotland you must have
all seen this procession of the shadows, as I have watched
it when fishing in Wales; let us always associate it with
the magic of a poet of nature as well as with the religious
processions of his people.</p>

<p><i>Lustrare</i>, <i>lustratio</i>, are words which, as I think, belong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
to an age of religion, that is, according to our formula,
of effective desire to be in right relation with the Power
manifesting itself in the Universe. In other processes
which are usually called purificatory, magic seems to
survive: the word <i>februum</i>, from which comes the name
of our second month, meant an object with magical
potency, such as water, fire, sulphur, laurel, wool, or the
strips of the victims sacrificed at the Lupercalia,
and the verb <i>februare</i> meant to get rid of certain unwholesome
or miasmatic influences by means of these
objects.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> What was the really primitive idea attached
to these words need not concern us now; but Varro, and
Ovid following him, explicitly explain them as meaning
<i>purifying</i> agents and processes,<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> from which we may
infer that they had a magical power to produce certain
desired conditions, or to protect from evil influences, like
charms and amulets. But <i>lustrare</i> and <i>lustratio</i> seem
to belong to an age when the thing to be driven or
kept away is rather spiritual mischief, and when the
means used are sacrifices and prayers, with processional
movement.</p>

<p>What is the original meaning of the word <i>lustrare</i>?
It seems to be a strong form of <i>luere</i>; and <i>luere</i> is
explained by Varro as equivalent to <i>solvere</i>.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> The word
<i>lustrum</i>, he says, <i>i.e.</i> the solemn five-yearly ceremony in
the Campus Martius, is derived from <i>luere</i> in the sense
of <i>solvere</i>, to pay; because every fifth year the contract-moneys
for the collection of taxes and for public undertakings
were paid into the treasury through the censors.
Servius,<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> doubtless following him, explains such expressions
as <i>peccata luere</i>, <i>supplicium luere</i>, on the same principle&mdash;in
the sense of payment, just as we speak of paying the
penalty. We might thus be tempted to fancy that the
root-idea of <i>lustrare</i> is to perform a duty and so get rid
of it, as we do in paying for anything we buy; but this
would be to misapprehend the original meaning of the
word as completely as Varro did when he explained
<i>luere</i> by reference to the payments of contractors. Varro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
and Servius do, however, suggest the right clue; they
see that the idea lurking in the word is that of getting
rid of something, but they understand that something
in the light, not of primitive man's intelligence, but of
the duty of man in a civilised State. What exactly it
was that was to be got rid of is a more difficult question;
but all that we have so far learnt about the early religious
ideas of the Romans strongly suggests that they were in
what we may call an advanced <i>animistic</i> stage of religious
ideas, and that whatever may have been the notion of
their primitive ancestors, they themselves, in these rites
as we know them, saw the means of getting rid of and
so keeping away hostile spirits. A French sociologist,
M. van Gennep, whose book <i>Les Rites de passage</i> I have
read with great interest, has kindly written me a long
letter in which he insists that this animistic interpretation of
<i>lustratio</i> is really superfluous, and that the idea of separation
alone, <i>i.e.</i> of separation between sacred and profane,
without any reference to spirits or <i>dei</i>, is a fully sufficient
explanation. So no doubt it may be among many savage
peoples; but he would probably allow that as a people
advances from one stage of superstition to another,
while it retains in outline the scheme of its rites, it will
apply new meanings to them in keeping with the changes
in its mental attitude. This is one of the most interesting
processes with which modern research has been occupied;
we are now familiar with the adoption of pre-Christian
ceremonies, with a complete change of meaning, in the
ritual of the Christian Church. These very processions
of <i>lustratio</i>, which had already been once metamorphosed
in an animistic period, were seized upon by the Roman
Church with characteristic adroitness, adapted to its ritual,
and given a new meaning; and the Catholic priest still
leads his flock round the fields with the prayers of the
<i>Litania maior</i> in Rogation week, begging a blessing on
the flocks and herds, and deprecating the anger of the
Almighty.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">445</a></p>

<p>But let us now pass briefly in review the more important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
of these rites of lustration and compare them with each
other; we shall find the essential features the same in
all of them.</p>

<p>The first permanent difficulty of new settlers in Latium
was to mark off their cultivated land from the forest or
waste land beyond it, and so, as M. van Gennep would
phrase it,<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> to make a margin of separation between the
sacred and the profane, within which the sacred processes
of domestic life and husbandry might go forward, undisturbed
by dangers&mdash;human, spiritual, or what not&mdash;coming
from the profane world without. The boundary was
marked out in some material way, perhaps by stones (<i>cippi</i>)
or posts, placed at intervals;<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> and thus "a fixed piece
of ground is appropriated by a particular social group, so
that if any stranger penetrated it he would be committing
a sacrilege as complete as he would if he trespassed in
a sacred grove or a temple." This boundary-line was
made sacred itself by the passage round it (<i>lustratio</i>)
at some fixed time of the year, usually in May,
when crops were ripening and especially liable to be
attacked by hostile influences, of a procession occupied
with sacrifice and prayer. The two main features of
the rite, as formulated by Cato in his treatise on agriculture,
are&mdash;1, the procession of the victims, ox, sheep, and
pig (<i>suovetaurilia</i>), the farmer's most valuable property;
2, the prayer to Mars pater, after libations to Janus and
Jupiter, asking for his kindly protection of the whole
<i>familia</i> of the farm, together with the crops of all kinds
and the cattle within the boundary-line.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> We are not
expressly told that this procession followed the boundary
throughout, but the analogy of other lustrations forbids
us to doubt it; and thus the rite served the practical
purpose of keeping it clear in the memory,&mdash;a matter
of the utmost importance, especially for the practical
Roman. In Cato's formula the farmer's object is to
ward off disease, calamity, dearth, and infertility; and it
is Mars who is invoked, <i>i.e.</i> a great god who has long
ago emerged from the crowd of impersonal spirits; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
we may safely believe that the primitive farmer used
other language, addressing the spirits of disease and
dearth themselves; and we may guess, if we will, that
again before that there was no invocation or sacrifice at
all, but that the object was only to mark the boundary
between land civilised and sacred and land uncivilised
and profane.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the farms and homesteads of the
early Latins were grouped together in associations called
<i>pagi</i>; and we can hardly doubt that these were subjected
to the same process of <i>lustratio</i> as the farms themselves.
We have no explicit account of a circumambulation in
this case, but we have in the later poets several charming
allusions to a <i>lustratio pagi</i>, and it is of a rite of this kind
that Virgil must have been thinking when he wrote the
beautiful passage in the first Georgic beginning "In
primis venerare deos";<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">449</a> and the lines</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">terque novas circum felix eat hostia fruges,</span>
<span class="i0">omnis quam chorus et socii comitentur ovantes, etc.,</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>clearly imply a procession with the object of keeping
away harmful influences from the crops at a critical time.
And when the city-state came into being we may be
equally sure that its <i>ager</i>, so long at least as it was small
enough to admit of such a processional ritual, was
lustrated in the same way. In historical times this <i>ager</i>
had become too extensive, and there is no procession
to be found among the duties of the Fratres Arvales as
we know them when they were revived by Augustus;
but we have not, of course, the whole of the "acta" of
the Brethren, and even if we had, it would not be likely
that we should find any trace of a practice which must
have been dropped in course of time as the Roman
territory increased. Let us go on to the beginnings of
the city, where we shall find the same principle and
practice applied in striking fashion.</p>

<p>As it was necessary to protect the homestead and its
land by a sacred boundary, so the city had to be clearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
marked off from all that was outside of it. Its walls
were sacred, or, strictly speaking, a certain imaginary
line outside of them called the <i>pomoerium</i> was sacred.
This is well shown in the traditional method of founding
a city even in historical times, <i>e.g.</i> a <i>colonia</i>, as described
by Varro, Servius, and Plutarch.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> A white ox and a
white cow were harnessed to a plough, of which the
share must be made of bronze&mdash;a rule which shows at
once the antiquity and the religious character of the
rite, for iron, as we saw, was taboo in most religious
ceremonies. A rectangular furrow was drawn where the
walls of the city were to be; the earth was turned
inwards to mark the future line of the wall, and the
furrow represented the future <i>pomoerium</i>. When the
plough came to the place where there was to be a gate,
it was lifted over it, and the ploughing resumed beyond
it. This probably meant, as Plutarch expressed it, that
the walls (or rather the <i>pomoerium</i>), were sacred while the
gates were profane; had the gates been holy, scruple
would necessarily have been felt about the passage in
and out of them of things profane. Thus the <i>pomoerium</i>
was a boundary line between the sacred and the profane,
like that of the farm; but in historical times it acquired
a more definite religious meaning, for within it there
could only dwell those deities who belonged to the city
and its inhabitants, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>di indigetes</i>, and who were
recognised as its divine inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> And only within its
limits could the <i>auspicia</i> of the city be taken.</p>

<p>We should naturally expect that this sacred boundary
would have its holiness secured or revived by an annual
<i>lustratio</i> like that of the farm and <i>pagus</i>; and so no
doubt it was. But the memory of this survives only in
the word <i>amburbium</i>, which, on the analogy of <i>ambarvalia</i>,
must mean a rite of this processional kind. Luckily
we have definite knowledge of the real <i>lustratio</i> of a
city in those ritualistic inscriptions of Iguvium which I
have more than once referred to.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> It is the <i>lustratio</i>
of the <i>arx</i>, the citadel of Iguvium, which we may guess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
to have been the original <i>oppidum</i> or germ of the
historical city. The details are complex, and show clear
traces of priestly organisation; but the main features
stand out unmistakably. A procession goes round the
<i>arx</i> (<i>ocris Fisia</i>), with the <i>suovetaurilia</i>&mdash;ox, sheep, and
pig&mdash;as in the Latin <i>lustratio</i>; at each gate it stops,
while sacrifice and prayer are offered on behalf of the
citadel, the city, and the whole people of Iguvium.
There were three gates, and each of them is the scene
of sacrifice and prayer, because they are the weak points
in the wall, and they need to be strengthened by annual
religious operations; such at least is the most obvious
explanation. Whether the Fratres Attiedii would have
been able to explain it thus we may doubt; neither in
the sacrificial ritual nor in the prayers, as recorded in
the inscription, do we find any clear trace of a distinction
between the sacred and the profane, or of the idea of a
hostile spiritual world outside the sacred boundary. So
far as we can judge from the prayers, the object is really
a religious one, to implore the deities of the city to
preserve it and all within it. The language of these
prayers hardly differs from that in which a Christian
Church of to-day asks for a blessing on a community.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">453</a></p>

<p>So far I have been speaking of the permanent separation
of land or city by a sacred boundary line from the
profane world without. But human beings <i>en masse</i>
might be subjected to the same process&mdash;an army, for
example, at the opening of the season of war; and so,
too, might its appurtenances&mdash;horses, arms, and trumpets.
In the account of the census and <i>lustrum</i> in the Campus
Martius given by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who passed
some years in Rome in the time of Augustus, we find
the <i>suovetaurilia</i> driven three times round the assembled
host and sacrificed to Mars. This was doubtless the
early form of the political census, which had a military
meaning and origin. But we have a more exact and
reliable account of a similar rite in the Iguvian documents,
which contain instructions for the <i>lustratio</i> of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
people apparently before a campaign.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> So far as we
can gather from the Umbrian text, the male population
was assembled in a particular spot in its military
divisions, and round this host a procession went three
times; at the end of each circuit there was sacrifice
and prayer to Mars and two female associates of his
power, the object of which, as we can read in the words
of the prayer, was to bless the people of Iguvium and
to curse its enemies, who were to be confounded and
frightened and paralysed.</p>

<p>Here religion of a rude sort has been superimposed
on the originally magical ceremonial. For the idea
must have been that by drawing a "magic circle"
around the host, which might have to march against
enemies living far beyond the pale of the <i>ager Romanus</i>
(or Iguvinus), where hostile magical influences might
be brought to bear against them, they were in some
mysterious way marked off, rendered "holy," and so
protected against the wiles of the enemy. A later and
animistic age would think of them as needing protection
against hostile spirits, of whose ways and freaks they
were of course entirely ignorant. Of these primitive
ideas about the danger of entering hostile territory and
of leaving your own, Dr. Frazer has collected some
examples in his <i>Golden Bough</i> (i. 304 foll.), both from
savage tribes and from Greek usage. A single parallel
from the pen of a Roman historian, which Dr. Frazer
has not mentioned, may suffice us here. Livy tells us
that the method in Macedonia was to march the whole
host in spring between the severed limbs of a dog:<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> the
principle is here the same as in Italy, but the method
differs slightly. In each case some mysterious influence
is brought to bear on the whole army without exception;
but in the one case a line is drawn round it, in the other
it passes through the parts of an object which must have
been supposed to be endowed with magical power.</p>

<p>And once more, in spring before the season of
arms, all the belongings of the host were subjected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
to some process of the same kind. I have alluded
to this in my lecture on the calendar, and need not
now reproduce the evidence of the Equirria at the end of
February and on March 14, or of the Quinquatrus on
March 19, when the <i>lustratio</i> took place of the shields
(<i>ancilia</i>) of the Salii, the war-priests of Mars, and the
Tubilustrium on March 23, which tells its own tale.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">456</a>
But I may recall the fact that the calendar supplies us
also with evidence that on the return of the host to
their own territory all these lustrations had to be
repeated in order to rid men, horses, arms, and trumpets
of such evil contagion as they might have contracted
during their absence. It may be that one special object
of lustration after the return of an army was to rid it,
with all belonging to it, of the taint of bloodshed, just
as the Jewish warriors and their captives were purified
before re-entering the camp.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> But in the Roman pontifical
law this idea is hardly discernible, and the only trace I
can find of it is a statement of Festus that the soldiers
who followed the general's car in a triumph wore laurel
wreaths "ut quasi purgati a caede humana intrarent
urbem."<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> I may add here that the passage of a
triumphing army through the Porta triumphalis, which
was probably an isolated arch in the Campus Martius
just outside the city wall,<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">459</a> most likely had as its original
meaning the separation of the host from the profane
world in which it had been moving; and the triumphal
arches of later times, which were within the city, were
thus developed architecturally from an origin which belongs
to the region of magic.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> To the same class of ideas, if
I am not much mistaken, belongs the familiar Italian
practice of compelling a surrendered army to pass under
the yoke. As Livy explains this when he first mentions
it, it was symbolical of subjection: "ut exprimatur
confessio subactam domitamque esse gentem";<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">461</a> and
this was no doubt the idea in the minds of the historical
Romans. But it may well have been that it had its
root in a process which was supposed to deprive the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
conquered enemy of all dangerous contagion&mdash;to separate
them from their own land and people before they came
into peaceful contact with their conquerors.</p>

<p>A last word before I leave this part of my subject.
Though it is interesting to try to get at the root-idea
of these processes of <i>lustratio</i>, we must remember
that in the Rome of history they had lost not only such
magical meaning as they ever had, but also much of
the religious meaning which in course of time was superimposed
upon it. The sacrifices and the prayers
remained, but the latter were muttered and unheard
by the people. And except in the country districts these
ceremonies were more and more absorbed, as time went
on, into the social, military, and political life of the
community, as <i>e.g.</i> the lustration of the host became a
political census; or they tended to disappear altogether,
like the <i>ambarvalia</i> and perhaps the <i>amburbium</i>. They
grew up in the religious experience of the Romans,
beginning with its very earliest and quasi-magical forms;
but they came at last to represent that experience no
longer, and when we meet with them in historical times
it is impossible to ascribe to them any real influence
on life and conduct. <i>Lustratio</i> never in pagan Italy
developed an ethical meaning as <i>catharsis</i> did in Greece.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">462</a>
But meaningless as they were, the stately processions
remained, and could be watched with pride by the
patriotic Roman all through the period of the Empire,
until the Roman Church adapted them to its own ritual
and gave them, as we saw, a new meaning. As the
cloud-shadows still move slowly over the hollows of the
Apennines, so does the procession of the patron saint pass
still through the streets of many an Italian city.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">463</a></p>

from that position by a verdict or sentence (see Wissowa, <i>R.K.</i>

mind of the Roman, who, as Macrobius says (iii. 2. 6) <i>se numinibus
obligat</i>, as an accused person is <i>obligatus</i> to the authorities of the
State (Mommsen, <i>Strafrecht</i>, 189 foll.). It is the natural tendency
of the Roman mind to give all transactions a legal sanction; but it
does not thence follow that the original idea was really thought of as
a contract, and we have only to reflect that the final act was a thank-offering
to see the difference between the civil and the religious
process.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_433_433" id="Footnote_433_433"></a><a href="#FNanchor_433_433"><span class="label">433</span></a> Macrobius iii. 9. 10, "exercitum quem ego me sentio dicere
fuga formidine terrore compleatis," etc. This is of comparatively
late origin, as it is addressed to Dis pater, who only became a Roman
deity in 249 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> (Wissowa, <i>R.K.</i> p. 257). The interesting feature
in this <i>devotio</i>, used at the siege at Carthage, is that it is not himself
whom the commander devotes&mdash;the common sense of the Romans
had got beyond that&mdash;but the enemy as substitutes for himself.
"Eos vicarios pro me fide magistratuque meo pro populo Romano
exercitibus do devoveo, ut me meamque fidem imperiumque legiones
exercitumque nostrum bene salvos siritis esse." Thus the enemy is
made the victim, and this is why the only gods invoked are the Di
Inferi, Dis pater, Veiovis, Manes, while in the older formula it is the
gods of Romans and Latins. Pacuvius in a praetextata called <i>Decius</i>
wrote: "Lue patrium hostili fusum sanguen sanguine" (Ribbeck,
p. 280). This is the language Ennius used before him of the sacrifice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
of Iphigenia: "ut hostium eliciatur sanguis sanguine," where, however,
the word <i>eliciatur</i> shows that it is magic. The curious thing in this
last passage is that the parallel passage in the Euripidean <i>Iph. in
Aul.</i> (1486) does not suggest magic. Is the idea Italian? The
curse (for such it really is) is to be witnessed by Tellus and Iuppiter,
and the celebrant points down and up respectively in invoking them,
as also in the <i>devotio</i> of Curtis in the Forum (Livy vii. 6), which
was an abnormal <i>procuratio prodigii</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_434_434" id="Footnote_434_434"></a><a href="#FNanchor_434_434"><span class="label">434</span></a> Cp. the language used by Livy of the second Decius (x. 29):
"prae se agere formidinem ac fugam ... contacturum funebribus
diris signa tela arma hostium." For spells or curses of this kind see
Westermarck i. 563: a curse is conveyable by speech, especially if
spoken by a magistrate or priest. "Among the Maoris the anathema
of the priest is regarded as a thunderbolt that an enemy cannot
escape." See also Robertson Smith, <i>Semites</i>, p. 434, for the Jewish
ban, by which impious sinners, or enemies of the city and its God,
were devoted to destruction. He remarks that the Hebrew verb to
ban is sometimes rendered "consecrate": Micah iv. 13; Deut. xiii.
16; and Joshua vi. 26 (Jericho), which exactly answers to the
consecratio of Carthage. For curses conveyable by sacrifices, as in

<h4>LECTURE X</h4>

<h5>THE FIRST ARRIVAL OF NEW CULTS IN ROME</h5>


<p>I said in my first lecture that the whole story of Roman
religious experience falls into two parts: first, that of the
formularisation of rules and methods for getting effectively
into right relations with the Power manifesting itself in
the universe; secondly, that of the gradual discovery of
the inadequacy of these, and of the engrafting on the State
religion of Rome of an ever-increasing number of foreign
rites and deities. The first of these stories has been
occupying us so far, and before I leave it for what will be
practically an introduction to succeeding lectures, it will
be as well for me to sum up the results at which we have
already arrived.</p>

<p>I began with what I called the protoplasm of religion,
the primitive ideas and practices which form the psychological
basis of the whole growth. The feeling of awe
and anxiety about that which is mysterious and unknown,
the feeling which the Romans called <i>religio</i>, seems to have
manifested itself in Italy, as elsewhere, in those various
ways which I discussed in my second and third lectures,
in the various forms of magic, negative and positive. We
find unmistakable evidence of the existence of those
strict rules of conduct called taboos, which fetter the mind
and body of primitive man, which probably arise from an
ineffective desire to put himself in right relations with
forces he does not understand, and which have their value
as a social discipline. Again, we find surviving in
historical Rome numerous forms of active or positive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
magic, by which it was thought possible to compel or
overcome those powers, so as to use them for your own
benefit and against your enemies. But I was careful to
point out that on the whole little of all this evidence of
the early existence of magic at Rome is to be found in
the public religion of the Roman State, and that the
natural inference from this is that at one time or another
there must have been a very powerful influence at work in
cutting away these obsolete root-leaves of the plant that
was to be, and in making of that plant a neat, well-defined
growth.</p>

<p>I went on to deal with the first stage in the working
of this influence, which we found reflected in the religion
of the family as we know it in historical times. The
family, settled on the land, with its homestead and its
regular routine of agricultural process, developed a more
effective desire to get into right relation with the Power
manifesting itself in the universe. Anxiety is greatly
lessened both in the house and on the land, because within
those limits there is a "peace" (or covenant) between the
divine and human inhabitants who have taken up their
residence there. The supernatural powers, conceived now
(whatever they may have been before) as spirits, are friendly
if rightly propitiated, and much advance has been made in
the methods of propitiation; magic and religion are still
doubtless mixed up together in these, but the tendency
seems to be to get gradually rid of the more inadequate
and blundering methods. In fact, man's knowledge of
the Divine has greatly advanced; spirits have some slight
tendency to become deities, and magic is in part at least
superseded by an orderly round of sacrifice and prayer,
which is performed daily within the house, and within the
boundary of the land at certain seasons of the year. This
stage of settlement and routine was the first great revolution
in the religious experience of the Romans, and
supplied the basis of their national character.</p>

<p>The second revolution which we can clearly discern,
and far the most important as a factor in Roman history,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
is that of the organisation of the religion of the city-state
of Rome. Doubtless there were stages intermediate
between the two, but they are entirely lost to us. We
had to concentrate our attention on the city of the four
regions&mdash;the first city we really know&mdash;and to examine
the one document which has survived from it, the so-called
calendar of Numa. In my fifth lecture I explained the
nature of that calendar, and noted how it reflects the life
of a people at once agricultural and military, and how it
must presuppose the existence of a highly organised legal
priesthood, or of some powerful genius for political as well
as religious legislation. The tradition of a great priest-king
is not wholly to be despised, for it expresses the
feeling of the Romans that religious law and order were
indispensable parts of their whole political and social life.
During the rest of these lectures I have been trying to
interrogate this religious calendar, with such help as could
be gained from any other sources, on two points: (1) the
conception, or, if we can venture to use the word, the
knowledge, which the Romans of that early city-state had
of the Divine; (2) the chief forms and methods of their
worship. We saw that they did not think of the divine
beings as existing in human form with human weaknesses,
but as invisible and intangible functional powers, <i>numina</i>.
Each had its special limited sphere of action; and some
were now localised within the <i>pomoerium</i>, or just outside
it within the <i>ager Romanus</i>, and worshipped under
a particular name. I suggested that this very settlement
had probably some influence in preparing them for assuming
a more definite and personal character, should the
chance be given them. In regard to the forms of cult
with which they were propitiated, I found in the ritual of
sacrifice and prayer a genuine advance towards a really
religious attitude to the deity, the sacrifices being meant
to increase his power to benefit the community, and the
prayers to diminish such inclination as he might have to
damage it; but that there are in these certain survivals
of the age of magic, which are, however, only formal, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
have lost their original significance. I found some curious
examples of such survivals in the rite of <i>devotio</i>, and in
vows generally a somewhat lower type of method in
dealing with the supernatural. But, on the other hand,
the forms of <i>lustratio</i>, at the bottom of which seems to lie
the idea of getting rid of evil spirits and influences, present
very beautiful examples of what we may really call
religious ceremony.</p>

<p>There was, then, in this highly-organised religion of the
city-state, in some ways at least, a great advance. But
in spite of this gain, it had serious drawbacks. Most
prominent among these was the fact that it was the
religion of the State as a whole, and not of the individual
or the family. Religion, I think we may safely say, had
placed a certain consecration upon the simple life of the
family, which was, in fact, the life of the individual; for
the essence of religion in all stages of civilisation lies in
the feeling of the individual that his own life, his bodily
and mental welfare, is dependent on the Divine as he and
his regard it. But to what extent can it be said that
religion so consecrated the life of the State as to enable
each individual in his family group to feel that consecration
more vividly? That would have constituted a real
advance in religious development; that was the result, if
I am not mistaken, of the religion of the Jewish State,
which with all the force of a powerful hierarchical authority
addressed its precepts to the mind and will of the individual.
But at Rome, though the earliest traces and
traditions of law show a certain consecration of morality,
inasmuch as the criminal is made over as a kind of propitiatory
sacrifice to the deity whom he has offended, yet
in the ordinary course of life, so far as I can discern, the
individual was left very much where he was, before the
State arose, in his relation to the Divine.</p>

<p>In no other ancient State that we know of did the
citizen so entirely resign the regulation of all his dealings
with the State's gods to the constituted authorities set over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>him. His obligatory part in the religious ritual of the
State was simply <i>nil</i>, and all his religious duty on days
of religious importance was to abstain from civil business,
to make no disturbance. Within the household he used
his own simple ritual, the morning prayer, the libation to
the household deities at meals; and it is exactly here
that we see a <i>pietas</i>, a sense of duty consecrated by
religion, which seems to have had a real ethical value,
and reminds us of modern piety. But in all his relations
with the gods <i>qua</i> citizen, he resigned himself to the
trained and trusted priesthoods, who knew the secrets of
ritual and all that was comprised in the <i>ius divinum</i>; and
by passive obedience to these authorities he gradually
began to deaden the sense of <i>religio</i> that was in him.
And this tendency was increased by the mere fact of life
in a city, which as time went on became more and more
the rule; for, as I pointed out, the round of religious
festivals no longer exactly expressed the needs and the
work of that agricultural life in which it had its origin.</p>

<p>It would be an interesting inquiry, if the material for
an answer were available, to try and discover how this
gradual absorption of religion (or rather religious duties)
by the State and its authorities affected the morality of
the individual Roman. It has often been maintained of
late that religion and morality have nothing in common;
and even Dr. Westermarck,<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> who, unlike most anthropologists,
treats the whole subject from a psychological
point of view, seems inclined to come to this conclusion.
For myself, I am rather disposed to agree with another
eminent anthropologist,<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> that religion and morality are
really elemental instincts of human nature, primarily undistinguishable
from each other; and if that be so, then
the over-elaboration of either the moral or religious law,
or of the two combined, will tend to weaken the binding
force of both. If, as at Rome, the citizen is made perfectly
comfortable in his relations with the Power manifesting
itself in the universe, owing to the complete mastery of
the <i>ius divinum</i> by the State and its officials, there will
assuredly be a tendency to paralyse the elemental religious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
impulse, and with it, if I am not mistaken, the elemental
sense of right and wrong. For in the life of a state with
such a legalised religious system as this, so long at least
as it thrives and escapes serious disaster, there will be few
or none of those moments of peril and anxiety in which
"man is brought face to face with the eternal realities of
existence,"<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> and when he becomes awakened to a new
sense of religion and duty. In the life of the family, the
critical moments of birth, puberty, marriage, and death
regularly recur, and keep up the instinct, because man is
then brought face to face with these eternal facts; there
is no need of extraordinary perils, such as tempests or
pestilences, to keep the instinct alive. But in the life of
the State as such there were no such continually recurring
reminders; even the old agricultural perils were out of
sight of the ordinary citizen. Thus the farthest we can
go in ascribing a moral influence to the State religion is
in giving it credit for helping to maintain that sense of
law and order which served to keep the life of the family
sound and wholesome. That it did to some extent perform
this service I have already pointed out;<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> and it is a
remarkable fact that the decay of the State religion was
coincident, in the last two centuries <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, with the decay
of the family life and virtues. But on the whole, as we
shall see, the <i>ius divinum</i> had rather the effect of hypnotising
the religious and moral instinct than of keeping it
awake. It needed new perils for the State as a whole to
re-create that feeling which is the root of the growth of
conscience; and when the craving did at last come upon
the Roman, which in times of doubt and peril has come
upon individuals and communities in all ages, for support
and comfort from the Unseen, it had to be satisfied by
giving him new gods to worship in new ways&mdash;aliens
with whom he had nothing in common, who had no
home in his patriotic feeling, no place in his religious
experience.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">468</a></p>

<p>I wish to conclude this first part of my subject by
giving some account of the first beginning of this intro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>duction
of new deities, <i>di novensiles</i> as they were called,<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">469</a>
into the old Roman religious world. Those, however, of
whom I shall speak here were not introduced as the
result of disaster or distress, but were simply the inevitable
consequence of the growing importance of the city
on the Tiber&mdash;of the beginnings of her commercial and
political relations with her neighbours, and also of her
own development in the arts of civilisation. The religious
system with which I have so far been dealing was the
exclusive property, we must remember, of those <i>gentes</i>,
with the families composing them, which formed the
original human material of the State, and were known as
<i>patrician</i>. If we had no other reason for being sure of
this, the fact that all State priesthoods were originally
limited to patrician families would be sufficient to prove
it;<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> even down to the latest times the <i>rex sacrorum</i>, the
three <i>flamines maiores</i>, and the <i>Salii</i> were necessarily of
patrician birth&mdash;a fact which had much to do with their
tendency to disappear in the last age of the Republic.</p>

<p>But in the course of the period within which the Numan
calendar was drawn up, this community of patrician
burghers began to suffer certain changes. A population
of "outsiders," as in so many Greek cities, had gained
admittance to the site of Rome, though not into its
political and religious organism.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> So solid a city, in such
an important position, was sure to attract such settlers,
whether from the Latins dwelling about it, or from the
Etruscans on the north, or the Greek cities along the
coast southwards and in Sicily. The Latins were, of
course, of the same stock as the Romans, and already in
some loose political relation to them; and as each Latin
city was open, like Rome, to Greek and Etruscan influences,
we should probably see in Latium an indirect
channel of communication between those peoples and
Rome, to be reckoned in addition to the direct and
obvious one. As Dr. J. B. Carter has well said,<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> "the
Latins, becoming rapidly inferior to Rome, were enabled
to do her at least this service, that of absorbing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
foreign influences which came, and in certain cases of
Latinising them, and thus transmitting them to Rome in
a more or less assimilated condition." As Dr. Carter has
been the first to explain the arrival of these new religious
influences to English readers, I shall in what follows
closely follow his footsteps. They indicate and also
reflect a change from agricultural economy and habits to
a society interested in trade and travel: I say interested,
because we cannot be quite sure how far the old Romans
engaged in such pursuits themselves, as well as admitting
from outside those who did, with their worships. They
indicate also the growth of an industrial population,
organised in gilds, as in the Middle Ages; here beyond
doubt the workers were mainly of native birth. Lastly,
they indicate an advance in military efficiency and, as a
result of this military progress, some change in the
relation of Rome to her fellow-communities of Latium.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first of these new deities to arrive was the
famous Hercules Victor or Invictus of the <i>ara maxima</i> in
the Forum Boarium, who continued for centuries to
accept the tithes of the booty of generals and the profits
of successful merchants. Virgil in the eighth <i>Aeneid</i><a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">473</a>
makes Evander show his guest this altar and the celebration
of its festival, and tell him the tale of Cacus and the
oxen and the cave on the Aventine hard by; the poet,
like every one else until the last few years, believed the
cult to be primeval and Roman. But one of the many
gains for the history of Roman religion which have
recently been secured&mdash;even since the publication of my
<i>Roman Festivals</i>&mdash;is the certainty that the Italian Hercules
is really the Greek Heracles acclimatised in the sister
peninsula, and that the cult of the <i>ara maxima</i>, though
that altar was inside the sacred boundary of the <i>pomoerium</i>,
was not native in Rome.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> It seems, however, almost
certain that it did not come direct from any part of
Hellas, though its position, close to the Tiber and its
landing-place, might naturally lead us to think so. It is
almost impossible to believe that Heracles would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
been allowed inside the <i>pomoerium</i>, had he been introduced
by foreigners in the strict sense of the word. No doubt
much has yet to be learnt about Hercules in Italy; but
recent painstaking researches have made it possible for us
to acquiesce in the belief that this Hercules of the <i>ara</i>
came from a Latin city,&mdash;from that Tibur which by
tradition was of Greek origin&mdash;"Tibur Argeo positum
colono,"&mdash;and which, like its neighbour Praeneste, was
curiously receptive of foreign influence.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> It is believed
that the Greek traders from Campania and Magna Graecia
made their way northwards through Latium, and thus
eventually reached Rome with the deity whom they seem
to have always carried with them. He was, in the words
of Dr. Carter,<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> a deity of whom, by the contagion of
commerce, the Romans already felt a great need, a god
of great power from whom came success in the practical
undertakings of life; and it was quite natural that his
shrine should be in the busy cattle-market of the city, if
we remember that the wealth of the early Romans, <i>pecunia</i>
as they called it, mainly consisted in sheep and oxen.
As Heracles in various forms was to be met with all over
the Mediterranean coasts, it would indeed be strange if he
were not found in the growing city commanding the
central water-way of Italy; and his appearance there may
be said to have put Rome in touch with the Mediterranean
business of that day. There he was destined to remain,
with all the honour of an oldest cult, though other cults
of the same god came in later, and were established quite
close to him; and though never a State deity of much
importance, he exercised a wholesome influence in matters
of trade, as the god who sanctioned your oath, and who
accepted the tithe of your gain which you had vowed at
the outset of an enterprise.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">477</a></p>

<p>In the same period, though the traditional date of their
temple is later, came the Twin Brethren, Castor and
Pollux, and found their way, like Hercules, into the city
within the <i>pomoerium</i>. The famous temple of Castor
(before whom his brother gradually gave way) was at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
the end of the Forum under the Palatine, close to the
fountain of Juturna, where the Twins watered their horses
after the battle of Lake Regillus; and there the beautiful
remains of the latest reconstruction of it still stand.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> This
position alone should make us feel confident that the cult
did not come direct from Greek sources; and it had its
origin, perhaps, in the period when Rome was in close
relation with Latin cities, which themselves had been
gradually absorbing the cults and products of the Greeks
of Campania. There is a strong probability that it came
from Tusculum, with which the legend of the Regillus
battle is closely connected, and where the cult had beyond
doubt taken strong root.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> Like the Hercules of the <i>ara
maxima</i>, the Twins were no doubt brought by the course
of trade, which was continually pushing up from the south;
for they too were favourites of the merchant adventurer,
and throughout Hellas were the special protectors of the
seafarer. Their connection with horses is well known, and
not as yet satisfactorily explained in its Roman aspect;
but Dr. J. B. Carter thinks that they first became prominent
in Greece when the Homeric use of chariots was abandoned
for a primitive kind of cavalry, and that "the Castor-cult
moved steadily northward (from Magna Graecia), carried,
as it were, on horseback," and that when it reached Rome
it became connected with the reorganisation of the cavalry.
This seems to be almost pure guess-work, and, attractive
as it is, I fear we cannot put much faith in it.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> The
position in the Forum, and the well-known connection of
both twins with oaths,<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> seem to me rather to suggest a
more natural origin in trade. I would suggest that the
equine character of the cult in Latium was secondary, and
that the connection of the temple and cult with the Roman
cavalry was a natural result, but not a primary feature, of
its introduction. I should be inclined to look on it as coming
in with the building of the temple, which was probably
of later origin than the original introduction of the cult.</p>

<p>Some time after the calendar was drawn up, a deity
was established on the Aventine, <i>i.e.</i> not within the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
<i>pomoerium</i>, whose arrival marks a development in the
organisation of handicraft. We cannot indeed <i>prove</i> that
the settlement of Minerva on the Aventine took place so
early, but we have strong grounds for the conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">482</a>
This temple was in historical times the religious centre of
trade-gilds; and these gilds were by universal Roman
tradition ascribed to Numa as founder, which simply means
that they were among the oldest institutions of the City-state.
As Minerva does not appear in the calendar, had
no <i>flamen</i>, and therefore must have been altogether outside
the original patrician religious system, the natural inference
is that the temple was founded, like the shrines of
Hercules and the Twin Brethren, towards the end of the
period we are dealing with, and was from the first the
centre of the gilds. Of those mentioned by Plutarch in
his life of Numa (ch. 17), we know that the following gilds
belonged to Minerva: <i>tibicines</i>, <i>fabri</i> (carpenters?), <i>fullones</i>,
<i>sutores</i>; and it is a reasonable guess that the others,
<i>coriarii</i>, <i>fabri aerarii</i>, and <i>aurifices</i>, were also under her
protection. These trades, as Waltzing remarks in his
great work on Roman gilds,<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> are all in keeping with the
rudimentary civilisation of primitive Rome; they are those
which were first carried on outside of the family. Workers
in iron are not among them; bronze is still the common
metal.</p>

<p>Now of course we must not go so far as to assume that
none of these trades existed before the cult of Minerva
came to Rome; but from her close association with them
all through Roman history, and from the fact that the
Romans were originally an agricultural folk, as the calendar
shows, with a simple economy and simple needs, it is
legitimate to connect the arrival of the goddess with the
growth of town life and the demand for articles once made
in rude fashion chiefly on the farms, and with a period
of improvement in manufacture, and the use of better
materials and better methods. Whence, then, did these
improvements come? This is only another way of asking
the question, Whence did Minerva come?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>By the common consent of investigators she came from
the semi-Latin town of Falerii in southern Etruria, where
these arts were practised by Etruscans, or those who had
learnt of Etruscans.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> Her name is Italian, not Etruscan;<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">485</a>
she was an old Italian deity taken over by the invading
Etruscans from the peoples whose land they occupied.
But while in the hands of Etruscans she had adopted
Greek characteristics, especially those of Athene, the
patroness of arts and crafts. She soon, indeed, appeared
with some of the character of Athene Polias, as we shall
see at the end of this lecture; but her real importance, far
down into the period of the Empire, was in the temple on
the Aventine, and in connection with the crafts. The dedication
day of the temple was March 19, which was known,
as we learn on the best authority, also as <i>artificum dies</i>.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">486</a></p>

<p>There was another famous temple on the Aventine
which by universal consent is attributed to the same period
as that of Minerva. Diana does not appear in the
calendar, and had no <i>flamen</i>; Roman tradition ascribed
her arrival to Servius Tullius, and we shall not be far
wrong if we place it at or towards the end of the age of
the kingship. The temple was celebrated as containing
an ancient statue of Diana, the oldest or almost the oldest
representation of a deity in human form known at Rome,
which was a copy of a rude image of Artemis at Massilia, of
the type of the famous &#958;&#8001;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#957; of the Ephesian Artemis.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">487</a>
It also contained a <i>lex templi</i> in Greek characters, and a
treaty or charter of a federation of Latin cities with Rome
as their head, which was seen by Dionysius of Halicarnassus
when in Rome in the time of Augustus.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">488</a></p>

<p>The explanation of the arrival of Diana is simple. The
<i>dies natalis</i> of the temple is the same as that of the famous
shrine of the same goddess at Aricia&mdash;the Ides of August.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">489</a>
Aricia was at this time the centre of a league of cities including
Tusculum and Tibur, with both of which, as we
have just seen, Rome was closely connected at this time;
a league which is generally supposed to have superseded
that of Alba, marking some revolution in Latium con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>sequent
on the fall of Alba.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> Diana was a wood-spirit, a
tree-spirit, as Dr. Frazer has taught us, with some relation
to the moon and to the life of women; of late she has
become familiar to every one, not as she was known later,
in the disguise of Artemis, but as the deity of that shrine&mdash;"pinguis
et placabilis ara Dianae"&mdash;of which the priest
was the Rex Nemorensis: he who "slew the slayer and
shall himself be slain."<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">491</a> But in those days it was only
the fact that she was the chief local deity of Aricia, the
leading city of the new league, which brought her suddenly
into notice. When the strategic position of Rome gave
her in turn the lead in Latium, Diana passed on from
Aricia to the Tiber, entered on a new life, and eventually
took over the attributes of Artemis, with whom she had
much in common. The Diana whom we know in Roman
literature is really Artemis; but Diana of the Aventine,
when she first arrived there, was the wood-spirit of Aricia,
and her temple was an outward sign of Rome's new position
in Latium: it was built by the chiefs of the Latin
cities in conjunction with Rome, and is described by Varro
as "commune Latinorum Dianae templum."<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> It was
appropriately placed on the only Roman hill which
was then still covered with wood, and was outside the
<i>pomoerium</i>.</p>

<p>There was one other goddess, a Latin one, who was
traditionally associated with this period, and especially
with king Servius Tullius&mdash;Fortuna, or Fors Fortuna;
she does not appear in the calendar, had no <i>flamen</i>, and
must have been introduced from outside. But it was long
before Fortuna became of any real importance in Rome,
and I shall leave her out of account here. She had two
homes of renown in Latium, at Antium and Praeneste, and
was in each connected with a kind of oracle, which seems
to have been specially resorted to by women before and
after childbirth. She was also very probably a deity of
other kinds of fertility; and in course of time she took on
the characteristics of the Greek Tyche, and became a
favourite deity of good luck.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">493</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>Let us pause for one moment to reflect on the character
of these new deities of whom I have been speaking: Hercules,
Castor, Minerva, Diana. It must be confessed that,
as compared with the great deities of the calendar, they
are uninteresting; with the exception, perhaps, of Hercules,
they do not seem to have any real <i>religious</i> significance.
They are local deities brought in from outside, and have
no root in the mind of the Roman people as we have so
far been studying it. They seem to indicate the growth
of a population in which the true old Roman religious
instinct was absent; they represent commerce, business,
handicraft, or politics, pursuits in which the old Roman
and Latin farmers were not directly interested; they were
suffered to be in Rome because the new population and
the new interests must of necessity have their own worships,
but they were not taken into the heart and mind of
the people. So at least it seems to us, after we have
been examining the development of the native religious
plant from its root upwards. But we must remember that
of that new population, its life and its needs, we know
hardly anything, and it would not be safe to assume that
the conception of Minerva had no influence on the conscience
of the artisan, or that of Hercules no power of
binding the trader to honest dealing and respect for his
oath. As for Diana, though, as Dr. Carter says, she had
been introduced "as part of a diplomatic game, not because
Rome felt any religious need of her," the fact that the
Latin treaty was kept in her temple has a certain moral
as well as political significance which ought not to be
overlooked. It is impossible to put ourselves mentally in
the position of the men who brought these cults to Rome,
or of the Romans who granted them admittance; but we
shall be on the safe side if we imagine the former at least
to have had a conviction that their dealings at Rome
would not prosper unless they were carried out with the
blessing of their own gods.</p>

<p>But we now come, in the last place, to the foundation
of a cult of a very different kind from these, and of far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
greater import than any of them in the history of Roman
religious experience. We have seen that the temple of
Diana on the Aventine meant the transference of the
headship of the Latin league from Aricia to Rome. When
Rome took over this headship, and by removing its religious
centre to Rome&mdash;or, perhaps more accurately, by offering
Diana of Aricia a new home by the Tiber&mdash;removed also
any danger of a new power growing up in Latium outside
her own influence, she seems to have taken another important
step in the same direction. Arch&aelig;ological evidence
confirms the tradition that at this time the temple of
Jupiter Latiaris, the real and original god of the league, on
the Alban hill, was rebuilt;<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> and as the remains of its
foundation are of Etruscan workmanship, we may believe
that the work was undertaken at that period of an Etruscan
dominion in Rome which no one now seriously doubts,
and which is marked by the Etruscan name Tarquinius,
and by the old tradition that Servius Tullius was really
an Etruscan bearing the Etruscan name Mastarna.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> Now
those in power at Rome at this time, whoever they were,
not content with rebuilding the ancient temple of Jupiter
on the Alban hill, conceived the idea of also building a
great temple at Rome, on the steep rock overlooking the
Forum, to the same deity of the heaven who had long
presided over the Latin league. The tradition was that
this temple was vowed by the first Tarquinius, begun by
the second, and finally dedicated by the first consul
Horatius in the year 509.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> It is quite possible that this
tradition indicates the truth in outline&mdash;that it was an
Etruscan who conceived the idea of the great work, and
that the foreign domination gave way to a Roman reaction
before the temple was ready for dedication. We cannot
know what exactly was the Etruscan intention as to the
cult; but we know that the temple was built in the Etruscan
style, that its foundations were of Etruscan masonry,<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> and
that the deities inhabiting it were three&mdash;a <i>trias</i>&mdash;a feature
quite foreign to the native Roman religion.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> Jupiter,
Juno, and Minerva had each a separate dwelling (<i>cella</i>)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
within the walls of the temple, which, in order to meet this
innovation, was almost as broad as it was long. Whether
this trias was the one originally intended by the Etruscan
king or kings it is impossible to say; but I have great
doubts of it. I confess that I have no ground but probability
to go on when I conjecture that a long period
elapsed between the beginning of this great undertaking
and the final completion, and that in the meantime many
things had happened of which we have no record; that
when the temple was finished it was in Roman hands,
though retaining its Etruscan characteristics, and especially
the combination of three deities; and that those three
deities were essentially Roman in conception. Roman,
too, was the idea that one of the three should be paramount;
the two goddesses never attained to any special
significance, and the temple always remained essentially
the dwelling of the great Jupiter, the Father of heaven.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">499</a></p>

<p>The cult-titles of this Jupiter, Optimus Maximus, the
best and greatest, seem to raise him to a position not
only far above his colleagues in the temple, but above all
other Jupiters in Latium or elsewhere, and presumably
above all other deities. They thus suggest a deliberate
attempt to place him in a higher position than even the
Jupiter Latiaris of the Mons Albanus, whose temple had
been rebuilt in the same period. The very novelty of
such cult-titles betrays both power and genius in their
originator; they are wholly unlike any we have met with
so far; they do not suggest a function or a locality or a
connection with some other deity; they stand absolutely
alone in the history of the Roman religion till far on in
the Empire.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">500</a> Here is no <i>numen</i> needed at a particular
season to bless some agricultural operation; Jupiter
Optimus Maximus seems hardly to be limited by space
or season, and is to be always there looking down on
his people from his seat on the hill which was henceforward
to be called Capitolinus, because the space which
had been prepared there for his reception bore the name
of Capitolium, the place of headship.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> These titles, Best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
and Greatest, call for reflection, for more thought than we
are apt to give them; one wonders whether they can be
as old as tradition claimed, and in fact at least one recent
writer has been tempted, without sufficient reason, to
date the whole foundation two centuries later than the
Tarquinii.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> To me they rather suggest the hypothesis
that the break-up of the Etruscan domination in Rome
was the work of a man or men inspired by a new national
feeling which ascribed the revolution to the great god of
the race, to whose shrine on the same hill the kings had
been used to bring the spoils of their enemies<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">503</a>; and
that they took advantage of the uncompleted Etruscan
temple, with its huge foundations and underground
<i>favissae</i>, to settle there a new Jupiter, better and greater
than any other, to whom his people would be for ever
grateful, and in whom they would for ever put their trust.
All older associations with cults of the Heaven-god were
to be banished from the Capitolium, just as all other
deities were believed to have fled from the spot, save
only Terminus; the ancient priest of Jupiter, the Flamen
Dialis, had no special connection with this temple and its
cult, which were under the immediate charge of an <i>aedituus</i>
only.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> Here was the centre of the public worship of the
State as a whole, not only of the old patrician State; and
no such ancient curiosity as the Flamen Dialis, who, as
I have suggested, was a survival from some older era of
Latin religious history, was to be supreme there. Here
the Consul of the free Republic was to offer, on entering
office, the victim&mdash;the white heifer of the Alban cult&mdash;which
his predecessor had vowed, and himself to bind his
successor to a like sacrifice; and this he did on behalf of
patrician and plebeian alike. Here the victorious general
was to deposit his spoils, reaching the temple in the
solemn procession of the <i>triumphus</i>, and wearing the
<i>ornamenta</i> of the deity himself; for here, contrary to all
precedent in the worship of Romans, there was an image
of the god wrought in terra cotta and brought from
Etruria.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> It is in connection with such solemn events as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
these that we may find the origin of those imposing processions
which for centuries were to impress the minds of
the Roman people, and indeed of their enemies also,
with the might and magnificence of their Empire; for
apart from the triumphal processions with which we are
all familiar, the scene at the entrance of new consuls on
their office must have been most impressive. They were
accompanied by the other magistrates, the Senate, the
priests in their robes of office, and by an immense crowd
of citizens. After the ceremony the Senate met <i>in the
temple</i> to transact the first religious business of the year.
Here too the tribal assembly met for the purpose of
enrolling the new levies before each season of war, in
order that the youths who were to fight the battles of
Rome might realise the presence of Rome's great protecting
deity. Even in the most degenerate days of the
Roman religion, though Jupiter had suffered from the
ridicule of playwrights or the speculations of philosophers,
an orator's appeal to the Best and Greatest looking down
on the Forum from his seat above it, could not fail to
move the hearers; "Ille, ille Iuppiter restitit," cried Cicero
in the peril of the Catilinarian conspiracy, "ille Capitolium,
ille haec templa, ille cunctam urbem, ille vos omnes salvos
esse voluit."<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">506</a></p>

<p>Nor was it only the State as represented by its officials
that could and did address itself to the worship of this
great god. It seems probable that the new idea of a
single guardian deity, with his two attendant goddesses,
for which the Romans were indebted to the genius (whoever
he may have been) who released them from the yoke
of the Etruscan, opened the cult to the individual in a
way which must have been a novelty in the religious life
of the people.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> The most memorable example of this is
in the famous story told of Scipio, the conqueror of
Hannibal, which is not likely to be an invention of the
annalists. As Gellius records it, it stands thus: Scipio
was wont to ascend to the temple just before daylight, to
order the <i>cella Iovis</i> to be opened for him, and there to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
remain alone for a long time, as if taking counsel with
the god about the affairs of the State. The dogs, it was
said, which guarded the entrance, astonished the temple-keepers
by treating him always with respect, while they
would attack or bark at others.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">508</a></p>

<p>The reader may remark, that during the last few
minutes I have wandered quite away from the Roman
religion which we have so far been trying to understand,
and he will be right. I have but just touched on this great
cult, which properly belongs to Rome of the Republic, in
order to show how great a change must have taken place,
how great a revolution must have been consummated,
when this temple arose on its Etruscan substructures.
We have marked two forward steps in the social and
political experience of the Romans: the settlement of the
family on the land and the organisation of the City-state
with its calendar. Here is a third, the liberation of
that State from a foreign dominion, and the development,
in matters both internal and external, which subjection
and liberation alike brought with them. In regard to
religious experience, the first produced the ordered
worship of the household, which had a lasting effect on the
Roman character; the second produced the <i>ius divinum</i>,
the priesthoods and the ritual for the service of the
various <i>numina</i> which had consented to take up their
abode in the city and its precincts. These two taken
together changed doubt and anxiety into confidence,
stilled the <i>religio</i> natural to uncivilised man, and developed
the machinery of magic into forms and ceremonies
which were more truly religious. Now we note a third great
social step forward, which brings with it a new conception
and expression of the religious unity of the State; henceforward,
alongside of a multiplicity of cults and of priests
attached to them, we have one central worship to which
all free citizens may resort, and a trinity of guardian
deities, of whom one, Jupiter Best and Greatest, is the
one presiding genius of the whole State.</p>

<p>Lastly, there can hardly be a doubt that this new cult<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
marks a more extensive communication with neighbouring
peoples than the State had as yet experienced or encouraged.
Etruria, Latium, and Greece, all seem to have
had a hand in it. Of its relation to the Latins and
Etruscans I have already spoken. It only remains for
me to note the fact that it was here, in this Capitoline
temple, according to unanimous tradition, that those
legendary "Sibylline books" were deposited which came
from a Greek source, and according to the story, from
Cumae.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> These mysterious books were destined to
change the whole character of the religion of the Romans
during the next two centuries; and this is why the
dedication of the great temple is a convenient halting-place
on our journey. I propose to begin the second
part of my subject by examining the nature of this
change, and then to pass on to others, until we have
reached the end of the religious experience of the genuine
Roman people.</p>

What he means here by morality is not "that elaborated by abstract

morality" may be a somewhat obscure term; but I think
it is highly probable that Mr. Crawley is, in part at least, right in

been made to explain the <i>plebs</i> as the original inhabitants of Latium,
and the Romans as conquering invaders; <i>e.g.</i> by Prof. Ridgeway
in his paper, "Who were the Romans," read to the British Academy,

The theory is a natural one, and not out of harmony with the facts
as known; but it has yet to be further developed and tested, and
as those who hold it are not as yet in agreement with each other,
and as the evidence which alone can prove it is of a very special
character, archaeological and linguistic, I have expressed myself
in terms of the older view.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_474_474" id="Footnote_474_474"></a><a href="#FNanchor_474_474"><span class="label">474</span></a> Wissowa, <i>R.K.</i> p. 219 foll.; Carter, <i>Religion of Numa</i>, p.
31 foll. The ground had been prepared for the new view by the
elaborate articles in Roscher's <i>Mythological Lexicon</i>, vol. ii. pp. 2253
foll. and 2901 foll. Of late a painstaking discussion by J. G.
Winter has appeared in the <i>University of Michigan Studies for
1910</i>, p. 171 foll.; he mainly confirms Wissowa's conclusions, but
provisionally accepts a suggestion of mine (<i>R.F.</i> 197) that the
tithe practice of the <i>ara maxima</i> may possibly have been of
Phoenician origin, and points out that E. Curtius made the same
suggestion as long ago as 1845. On p. 269 he also dwells, very
properly, I think, on the part which the Etruscans may have had
in the dissemination of the myth and cult of the Greek Heracles.
Wissowa, however, stoutly maintains that these are simply Greek
and of commercial origin. It has been Wissowa's special and
valuable function to elucidate the Greek origin of many Roman
cults and legends; but I doubt if he has adequately considered
the influence of other peoples, and in particular of Phoenicians and
Etruscans. Certainly the Hercules question is not finally settled
by his masterly analysis of it in <i>R.K.</i> p. 220 foll. But most
of what I said in <i>R.F.</i> about the Hercules of the <i>ara maxima</i>
may now be considered obsolete; and I may add that my remarks
on the supposed connection of Hercules with Genius, Dius Fidius,
and Jupiter in the same work, p. 143 foll., have lost much strength
since Wissowa's book appeared. Yet I am not prepared to accept
the view which would deny to Hercules on Italian soil all contamination
with Italian ideas; as Willamowitz-Moellendorf puts it
(<i>Herakles</i>, ed. 2, vol. i. p. 25), "Die Italiker haben dem K&ouml;rper,
den sie &uuml;bernahmen, den Odem ihrer eigenen Seele eingeblasen:
aber wie der Name ist der Gestalt des Hercules hellenischer
Import." There are points in connection with the Roman Hercules,
<i>e.g.</i> the <i>nodus herculaneus</i> of the bride's girdle, which Wissowa
does not explain, and which, so far as I can see, can only be
explained by assuming that, as might have been expected, the
Greek Hercules became to some extent entangled in the web of
Italian thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_475_475" id="Footnote_475_475"></a><a href="#FNanchor_475_475"><span class="label">475</span></a> The cult was Greek in detail; <i>Graeco ritu</i>, according to
Varro as quoted by Macrobius iii. 6. 17; see also references in
Wissowa, <i>R.K.</i> 222, note 2. Following R. Peter in the articles
in Roscher, I assumed, in <i>R.F.</i> p. 194, that this might be a later
reconstruction of an originally Italian cult; but for the present
it is safer to look on the <i>Graecus ritus</i> as primitive, and on the presence
of Salii, a genuine Italian institution, as brought from Tibur by
the gens Pinaria, of which there is a trace in that city (<i>C.I.L.</i> xiv.
3541). There also Salii were engaged in the cult of Hercules Victor,
to whom tithes were also offered (<i>C.I.L.</i> xiv. 3541). The evidence
for the theory that the cult came to Rome from Tibur is summarised
by Wissowa, <i>R.K.</i> p. 220.</p></div>

never appear in <i>lectisternia</i> at Rome, as they do at Tusculum,

way of his conclusion; the Dioscuri were very strong in the
Peloponnese, yet the Spartans neglected the use of cavalry. At
any rate the theory needs careful historical testing. See article
"Dioscuri" in Pauly-Wissowa, <i>Real-Encycl.</i> It would seem
natural that when once the cult had been introduced by traders
it might become specially attached to the cavalry, owing to the
ancient connection of the Twins with horses.</p></div>

to be too certain of the absence of any idea of luck or chance in the
original conception of Fortuna: the word <i>fors</i>, so far as we know,
never had any other meaning, and the deity Fors must be a personification
of an abstraction, like Ops, Fides, and Salus. See
Axtell, <i>Deification of abstract idea in Roman literature</i>, p. 9, with
whom I agree in rejecting the notion of Marquardt and Wissowa
that she was a deity of horticulture. He rightly points out that she
is not included in the list of agricultural deities in Varro, <i>R.R.</i>

Jupiter, 655), but (1) Festus, 290, mentions sacerdotes, Ovid, <i>Fasti</i>
i. 588, castus sacerdos only; and (2) this sacrifice may well, as
O. Gilbert conjectured, have originally taken place in the Regia
(<i>Gesch. und Topogr. Roms</i>, i. 236). In any case the Flamen was
not in any special sense priest of Iup. Opt. Max.</p></div>

<h4>LECTURE XI<a name="FNanchor_501A" id="FNanchor_510A"></a><a href="#Footnote_510A" class="fnanchor">510a</a></h4>

<h5>CONTACT OF THE OLD AND NEW IN RELIGION</h5>


<p>I said at the beginning of my first lecture that Roman
religious experience can be summed up in two stories.
The first of these was the story of the way in which a
strong primitive religious instinct, the desire to put yourself
in right relation with the Power manifesting itself in
the universe, <i>religio</i> as the Romans called it, was gradually
soothed and satisfied under the formalising influence of
the settled life of the agricultural family, and still more
so under the organising genius of the early religious
rulers of the City-state. This story I tried to tell in
the last few lectures. The second story was to be that
of the gradual discovery of the inadequacy of this early
formalised and organised religion to cope with what we
may call new religious experience; that is, with the
difficulties and perils met with by the Roman people in
their extraordinary advance in the world, and with the
new ideas of religion and morals which broke in on them
in the course of their contact with other peoples. This
story I wish to tell in the present course of lectures. It
is a long and complicated one, including the introduction
of new rites and ideas of the divine, the anxious attempts
of the religious authorities to put off the evil day by
stretching to the uttermost the capacity of the old forms,
and the final victory of the new ideas as Roman life and
thought became gradually hellenised.</p>

<p>I propose to divide the story thus. In the latter part
of this first lecture I will deal with the first introduction
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>of Greek rites into the State worship under the directions
of the so-called Sibylline books. Then I will turn to the
efforts of the lay priesthoods, pontifices and augurs, to
meet the calls of new experience by formalising the old
religion still more completely in the name of the State,
until it became a mere skeleton of dry bones, without
life and power. That will bring us to the great turning-point
in Roman history, the war with Hannibal, to the
religious history of which I shall devote my fourth lecture;
and the fifth will pursue the subject into the century
that followed. In the next lecture I hope to sketch the
influence on Roman religious ideas of the Stoic school of
philosophy, and in the seventh to discuss, so far as I may
be able, the tendency towards mysticism prevalent in the
last period of the life of the Republic. My eighth lecture
I intend to devote to the noble attempt of Virgil to combine
religion, legend, philosophy, and consummate art in
a splendid appeal to the conscience of the Roman of that
day. Then I turn to the more practical attempt of
Augustus to revive the dying embers of the old religion;
and in my last lecture I shall try to estimate the contribution,
such as it was, of the religious experience we have
been discussing, to the early Christian church.</p>

<p>We shall shortly hear so much of petrifaction and
disintegration, that it may be as well, before I actually
begin my story, to convince ourselves that the old religion
was in its peculiar way a real expression of religious feeling,
and not merely a set of meaningless conventions and
formulae. It was the positive belief of the later Romans
that both they and their ancestors were <i>religiosissimi
mortales</i>,<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> full to the brim, that is, of religious instinct,
and most scrupulous in fulfilling its claims upon them;
for the word <i>religio</i> had come, by the time (and probably
long before the time) when it was used by men of letters,
to mean the fulfilment of ritualistic obligation quite as
much as the anxious feeling which had originally suggested
it.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> Cicero, writing in no rhetorical mood, declared that,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>as compared with other peoples, the Romans were far
superior "in religione, id est cultu."<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> This is in his work on
the nature of the gods; in an oration he naturally puts it
more strongly: "We have overcome all the nations of the
world, because we have realised that the world is directed
and governed by the will of the gods."<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> Sallust, Livy,
and other Roman prose writers have said much the same
thing<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">514</a>; the <i>Aeneid</i> as a whole might be adduced as evidence,
and in a less degree all the poets of the Augustan age.
Foreigners, too, were struck with the strange phenomenon,
in an age of philosophic doubt. Polybius in the second
century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> declared his opinion that what was reckoned
among other peoples as a thing to be blamed, <i>deisidaimonia</i>,
both in public and private life, was really what was holding
together the Roman state.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> Even in the wild century
that followed, Posidonius could repeat the assertion of
Polybius, and in the age of Augustus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
then resident at Rome, looking back on the
early history of Rome, stated his conviction that one
needed to know the <i>pietas</i> of the Romans in order to
understand their wonderful career of conquest.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">516</a> Aulus
Gellius, in a curious passage in which he notes that the
Romans had no deity to whose activity they could with
certainty ascribe earthquakes, describes them as "in constituendis
religionibus atque in dis immortalibus animadvertendis
<i>castissimi cautissimique</i>,"&mdash;a rhetorical but happy
conjunction of epithets. He means that they would
order religious rites, though ignorant of the <i>numen</i> to
whom they were due.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">517</a></p>

<p>It might be argued that these later writers knew really
little or nothing about the primitive Romans, and that
these passages only prove that this people had an extraordinary
scrupulosity about forms and ceremonies in this
as in other departments of action. But the argument will
not hold; the survival of all this formalism into an age of
disintegration really proves beyond a doubt that there
must have been a time when these forms really expressed
anxieties, fears, convictions, the earliest germs of <i>conscience</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>May we not take the constant occurrence in literature
of such phrases as <i>dis faventibus</i>, <i>dis iuvantibus</i> or <i>volentibus</i>,
as evidence of an idea deeply rooted at one time in the
Roman mind, that nothing should be undertaken until
the will of the deities concerned had been ascertained and
that early form of conscience satisfied? Let us remember
that the whole story of the <i>Aeneid</i> is one of the bending
of the will of the hero, as a type of the ideal Roman,
to the ascertainable will of the powers in the universe.</p>

<p>And we have abundant evidence that as a matter of
fact the good-will of the divine inhabitants of house and
city was asked for whenever any kind of work was undertaken,&mdash;even
the ordinary routine work of the farm or
of government. In the household every morning some
offering with prayer was made to the Lar familiaris in
historical times, and again before the <i>cena</i>, the chief meal
of the day.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> On Kalends, Nones, Ides, and on all <i>dies
festi</i> a <i>corona</i> was placed on the hearth, and prayer was
made to the Lar; we know that this was so in the old
Roman home, because in the second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Cato
instructs the <i>vilicus</i> to discharge these duties on behalf of
the absent or non-resident owner.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">519</a> Before the flocks
were taken out to summer pasture, and doubtless when
they returned, some religious service (so we should call it)
was held,<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> just as in the Catholic cantons of Switzerland
the blessing of God is asked when the cows first ascend to
the alpine pastures, and again when they leave them for
the valleys. Before a journey the later Romans prayed
for good fortune;<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">521</a> in the old times travelling was of
course unusual, and when it did occur the traveller was
surrounded by so many spiritual as well as material
dangers that <i>special</i> religious measures must have been
taken, as by fetials or armies on entering foreign territory.
The survival of the same kind of belief and practice is
also seen in private life in the religious commendations of
some authors at the outset of their literary work; Varro,
for example, at the beginning of his work on agriculture,
calls on all the agrarian deities (<i>iis deis ad venerationem
advocatis</i>)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span> before he goes on to mention even the bibliography
of his subject.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">522</a> Livy in the last sentence of his
preface would fain imitate the poets in calling on the
gods to bless and favour his undertaking. And in all
time of their tribulation, even if not in all time of their
wealth, the pious Romans sought help from the deities
from whom help might be expected; if, at least, the many
instances occurring in Roman poetry may point to a
practice of the ordinary individual and family.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">523</a> So too,
if we may judge by many passages in the plays of Plautus
and Terence,<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">524</a>&mdash;if here we have genuine Roman usage,
as is probable,&mdash;the feeling of dependence on a Power
manifesting itself in the affairs of daily life is shown also
in the expression of <i>thankfulness</i> which followed success
or escape from peril. Gratitude was not a prominent
characteristic of the Roman, but I have already remarked
on the presence of it in the practice of the <i>votum</i>, and
there is at least some evidence that it was recognised as
due to benignant deities as well as human beings.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">525</a></p>

<p>In public life, throughout Roman history, the forms of
religious rites were maintained on all important occasions.
When Varro wrote a little manual of Senatorial procedure
for the benefit of the inexperienced Pompeius when
consul in 70 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, he was careful to mention the preliminary
sacrifice and <i>auspicatio</i>, performed by the presiding
magistrate, who also had to see that the business
<i>de rebus divinis</i> came first on the paper of agenda.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">526</a> At
one time every speaker invoked the gods at the beginning
of his oration, as well indeed he might in a situation so
unusual and trying for a Roman before the days of Greek
education; and the earliest speeches preserved in the
literary age, <i>e.g.</i> those of Cato and the Gracchi, retained
the religious exordium.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">527</a> We have a trace of the Gracchan
practice in a famous passage at the end of the work called
<i>Rhetorica ad Herennium</i> of <i>circ.</i> 82 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, where the death
of Ti. Gracchus is graphically described.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> But there is
no need to multiply examples of public religious formalism
on occasions of all kinds, on entering on an office, founding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>a colony, leaving Rome for a provincia, and so on; some
of them I have already mentioned, others are familiar to
all classical students.</p>

<p>So let us not hesitate for a moment to give this people
credit for their religiousness. True, their neighbours,
Greeks like Polybius, approved of it only with an ironical
smile on their lips, as we may smile at the devoted
formalism of extreme Catholic or Protestant, while we
secretly&mdash;if we have some sympathy with strangely
varying human nature&mdash;admire the confidence and regularity
that we cannot ourselves claim. At the moment
where I have thus paused before beginning my second
story, at the end, that is, of the regal period, I believe that
this religious system, though perhaps beginning to harden,
still meant a profound belief in the Power thus manifested
in many forms, and an ardent and effective desire to be
in right relation to it. I believe that it contained the
germ of a living and fruitful growth; but that growth
was at this very moment arrested by the beginning of a
process of which I shall have much to say in the next
two or three lectures.</p>

<p>But it is hard to realise this better side of the religion
of a hard and practical people, and all the more so since
it is the worse side that is almost always presented to us
in modern books. It is hard to realise that it was not
merely a system of insurance, so to speak, against all
kinds of material evils,&mdash;and here again all the more so
because there is a tendency just now to reduce both
religion and law to an origin in magic, leaving the
religious instinct, the <i>feeling of dependence</i>, the progenitor
of conscience, quite out of account. One must
indeed be thoroughly familiar with Roman literature and
antiquities to overcome these difficulties, to discover the
spiritual residuum in the Roman character beneath all
its hardness and utilitarianism. Before we pass on to
the task before us, let me make two suggestions for
the help of those who would endeavour to find this
spiritual residuum. The first is that they should consider
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>the history and true meaning of three great words which
Latin language has bequeathed to modern speech,&mdash;<i>religio</i>,
the feeling of awe, taking practical shape in the
performance of authorised ceremonies; <i>sacrum</i>, that which
by authoritative usage is made over without reserve to
the divine inhabitants of the city; and last but not least,
<i>pietas</i>, the sense of duty to god and man alike, to all
divine and human beings having an authorised claim upon
you. And this word <i>pietas</i> shall introduce my second
suggestion&mdash;that there is no better way of getting to
understand the spirit of the Roman religion than by continual
study of the <i>Aeneid</i>, where the hero is the ideal
Roman, <i>pius</i> in the best and widest sense. What makes
the <i>Aeneid</i> so helpful in this way is the poet's intimate
and sympathetic knowledge of the religious ideas of the
Italians, in which we may see reflected those of the
Roman of the age we are now dealing with: his love too
of antiquity and of all ancient rites and legends; and his
conviction that the great work of Rome in the world had
been achieved not only by <i>virtus</i> but by <i>pietas</i>. What
has been won by <i>virtus</i> must be preserved by <i>pietas</i>, by
the sense of duty in family and State,&mdash;that is the moral
of the <i>Aeneid</i>. In no other work of Roman genius is
this idea found in anything like the same degree of prominence
and consistency; and when a student has steeped
his mind well in the details of the Roman worship, and
begins to weary of what must seem its soulless Pharisaism,
let him take up the <i>Aeneid</i> and read it right through for
the story and the characters. I will venture to say that
he will think better both of the Romans and their poet
than he ever did before. But of the <i>Aeneid</i> I shall have
more to say later on; at present let us turn to the less
inspiring topics which must occupy us for the next few
lectures.</p>

<p>The last fact of Roman religious history which I
mentioned last year was the building of the great
Capitoline temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, and I
then explained why this constituted a religious revolution.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>The next temple of which tradition tells us was destined
for another trias, Ceres, Liber, and Libera; the traditional
date was 493 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, the cause a famine, and the site was at
the foot of the Aventine, the plebeian quarter outside the
pomoerium, close to the river where corn-ships might be
moored.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> Ceres, Liber, and Libera are plainly neither
more nor less than the three Greek corn deities, Demeter,
Dionysus, and Persephone, in a Latin form,<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">530</a> whose
worship was prominent in South Italy and Sicily; and
unless we throw tradition overboard entirely, as indeed has
often been done, the inference is obvious that this trias
came from the Greeks of the south with an importation of
corn to relieve a famine which pressed especially on the
plebs. It is a fact that the temple and its cult remained
always closely connected with the plebs; they were under
the charge of the plebeian aediles, who also in historical
times had the care of the corn-supply necessary for the
city population.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">531</a> Thus, though we need not accept in
full Livy's statement that the very next year corn was
imported from Etruria, Cumae, and Sicily, it cannot be
denied that there is a strong consensus in the various
traditions about the temple, which taken together suggest
a Greek, non-patrician, and early origin. That the cult
had at all times a Greek character is undisputed fact.</p>

<p>But I am not so much concerned with the temple itself
as with the date and the manner of its foundation. It
was said to have been founded in the year 496, and
dedicated in 493, in obedience to directions found in "the
Sibylline books," which books, according to the well-known
tradition, had been acquired by the last Tarquin, after
some haggling, from an old woman, and placed in the
charge of <i>duoviri sacris faciundis</i>. The story itself is
worthless in detail; but the question for us is whether it
can be taken as showing that the Sibylline influence then
pervading the Greek world gained a footing at Rome in
any form so early as this. Was the temple really founded
in 496, or at some time thereabout? And was it founded
in obedience to some Sibylline direction? These questions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>are of real importance, for upon our answer to them
depends the date of the beginning of a gradual metamorphosis
of the Roman religious practice. The so-called
Sibylline books and their keepers were responsible, as we
shall see directly, for the introduction at Rome of what
was known as the <i>Graecus ritus</i>,&mdash;for the foundation of
temples to deities of Greek origin, and for other rites
which initiated an entirely new type of religious feeling.
We need to be sure when all this began.</p>

<p>In the first place, so far as I can judge, it is almost
impossible to dissociate the origin of the temple from
Sibylline influence. As we have seen, the cult was
Greek, and all such Greek cults of later times were
introduced by the keepers of the Sibylline books; and
further, the records of temple foundations were among the
most carefully preserved facts in Roman annals.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">532</a> I think
it is hardly possible to suppose that a cult which came,
not from Latium or southern Etruria, like those of Diana,
Minerva, and the Capitoline deities, but from some Greek
region to the south, and probably from Sicily, could have
been introduced by Roman authorities unaided by Greek
influence. If that be so, and if we can show that the
temple really belongs to this early age, then we have a
strong probability that the Sibylline influence gained a
footing at Rome at the very beginning of the republican
period.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">533</a></p>

<p>There is one curious fact in connection with the temple
that in my opinion goes far to prove that the traditional
date is not far out. Pliny tells us explicitly that the two
Greek artists who decorated the temple, Damophilus and
Gorgasus, inscribed their names on the walls, and he added
that the work of the former would be found on the right
and that of the latter on the left.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> Nothing more is known
about them; but I am assured that the fact that they
signed their names and added these statements suits the
character of Greek art in the archaic age 580 to 450 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
No signatures of artists are known earlier than about 580;
then comes a period when signatures are found, sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>with statements such as these. And lastly, about
450, we begin to find simple signatures without any other
words.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">535</a> Thus the presumption is a strong one that the
temple belongs to a time earlier than 450; and if that be
so, then I think the inference holds good that the Sibyl
first gained a footing at Rome about the same time.
There are indeed some reasons why we should not put
this event in the period of the kings;<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">536</a> but if we accept
the traditional date of the temple we may put it any time
between 509 and 496.</p>

<p>I have purposely used vague terms, such as Sibylline
<i>influence</i>, instead of speaking in the old manner of
Sibylline <i>books</i> or oracles, because it is almost incredible
that at so early a date it could have been possible to
divulge any contents of a store of writings such as must
have been most carefully treasured and concealed. This
has been shown conclusively to be out of the question in
Diels' now famous little book "<i>Sibylline Leaves</i>." But we
may also follow Diels in assuming that about the end of
the sixth century some kind of Greek oracle or oracular
saying did actually arrive at Rome, purporting to be an
utterance of the famous Sibyl of Cumae.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">537</a></p>

<p>But what <i>was</i> this Sibylline influence which thus
penetrated to Rome, if I am right, at the beginning of
the fifth century? It is no part of my design to discuss
the history of Greek mysticism, though we shall
hear something more of it in a later lecture. It will
be enough to remind you that in the sixth century
Greece was not only full of Orphism and Pythagoreanism,
but of floating oracular <i>dicta</i> believed to emanate from a
mystic female figure, a weird figure of whom it is hard to
say how far she was human or divine; and of whose
origin we know nothing, except that her original home
was, as we might expect, Asia Minor. She was inspired
by Apollo,<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">538</a> it was said, like the Pythia, and like her too
became &#7956;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#959;&#987; (<i>possessed</i>) when uttering her prophecies;
this is the earliest fact we know about her, for a famous
fragment of Heracleitus represents her as uttering sayings
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>"with frenzied lips,"<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">539</a>&mdash;a tradition of which Virgil has
made good use in the sixth <i>Aeneid</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">non vultus, non color unus,</span>
<span class="i0">non comptae mansere comae; sed pectus anhelum,</span>
<span class="i0">et rabie fera corda tument.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But more to our purpose is the sober judgment of Plato a
century after the first Roman experience of her, who in
the <i>Phaedrus</i> classes her among those who have wrought
<i>much good</i> by their inspired utterances.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> This passage
may help us to understand how ready men were at that
time to turn for aid in tribulation to what they believed to
be divine help, to an inspired wisdom beyond the range of
the local deities of their own city-states.</p>

<p>This Sibyl became gradually localised in certain Greek
cities, and thereby broke up, as it were, into several Sibyls.
One of these Sibylline homes was at Cumae in Campania,
the oldest Greek city in Italy, and this enables us to
explain easily how the name and fame of the Sibyl
reached Rome. Dim as is all early Roman history, the
one clear fact of the sixth century is, as we have seen,
the rapid advance of the Etruscans, their occupation of
Rome, Praeneste, and other Latin cities, and their conquest
of Campania, which is now ascribed to that same
age.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">541</a> Legend told in later days how the last Etruscan
king had taken refuge at Cumae after his expulsion from
Rome, and it is just possible that it may here be founding
upon some dim recollection of a fact. However this
may be, it is plain that it was through the great Etruscan
disturbance of that period that Rome came to make trial
of Sibylline utterances. In a moment of distress&mdash;the
famine of which I spoke just now, and which I take to be
historical because the remedy, the temple under the
Aventine, was so closely connected with the corn-supply&mdash;she
sent for or admitted an utterance of the Sibyl of
Cumae, with whom she had come into some kind of contact
through her Etruscan kings.</p>

<p>Let us consider that this foreign dynasty must have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>brought a new population to the city on the Tiber, the
chief strategic point of middle Italy,&mdash;a new element of
plebs, whatever the old one may have been.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> We have
seen signs, even in the religious history of this age, that
commerce and industry were increasing, and that their
increase was due to a movement from without, rather than
to the old patrician <i>gentes</i>. When the Etruscan dynasty
fell and the old patrician influence was restored, the
government must have been face to face with new difficulties,
and among them the supply of corn for an
increasing population in years of bad harvest. With a
fresh source of supply from the south came the cult of the
Greek corn-deities at the bidding of a Sibylline utterance;
and henceforward that remedy was available for other
troubles. But the patrician rulers of Rome were true, it
would seem, as far as was possible, to the old ways, and
for a long time they used this foreign remedy very sparingly.
At what date the utterances were collected in
"books" and deposited in the Capitoline temple we do
not know, nor have we any certain knowledge of their
original nature or form. Tradition said that the collection
dated from the last king's reign, and that it was placed in
the care of <i>duoviri sacris faciundis</i>, as we have seen, who
in 367 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> gave way to <i>decemviri</i>, five of whom might
be members of the plebs. I am myself inclined to conjecture
that this comparatively late date may be the real
date of the origin of a <i>permanent collection</i> and a <i>permanent
college of keepers</i>, and that the earlier <i>duoviri</i> were only
temporary religious officers, <i>sacris faciundis</i>, <i>i.e.</i> for the
carrying out of the directions of Sibylline utterances
specially sought for at Cumae. They would thus be of
the same class as other special commissions appointed
by the Senate for administrative purposes;<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> while the
decemviri, though retaining the old title, were permanent
religious officers appointed to collect and take
charge of a new and important set of regulations for the
benefit of the community, and one which concerned the
plebs at least as much as the patricians.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>But I must turn to the more important question how
far, down to the war with Hannibal, when I shall take up
the subject afresh, the Roman religion was affected for
good or harm by these utterances and their keepers.
They took effect in two ways: either by introducing new
deities and settling them in new temples, or by ordering
and organising new ceremonies such as Rome had never
seen before.</p>

<p>The introduction of a new deity now and again was
not of great account from the point of view of religion,
except in so far as it encouraged the new ceremonies;
the Romans had never taken much personal interest in
their deities, and the arrival (outside the pomoerium in
each case) of Hermes under the name of Mercurius, or
Poseidon bearing the name of the old Roman water
<i>numen</i> Neptunus, or even of Asclepios with a Romanised
name Aesculapius, would not be likely to affect greatly
their ideas of the divine. These facts have rather a
historical than a religious significance; Hermes Empolaios,
for example, suggests trade with Greek cities, perhaps in
grain,<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">544</a> and belongs therefore to the same class as Ceres,
Liber, Libera, of whom I have already spoken. The
arrival of Poseidon-Neptune may mean, as Dr. Carter has
suggested, a kind of "marine insurance" for the vessels
carrying the grain from Greek ports.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> The settling of
Aesculapius in the Tiber island in 293, as the result of a
terrible pestilence, is interesting as being the first fact
known to us in the history of medicine at Rome; the
temple became a kind of hospital on the model of Epidaurus,
where the god had been brought in the form of a snake
by an embassy sent for the purpose, and the priests who
served it were probably Greeks skilled in the healing art.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">546</a>
This last case is a curious example of new Roman religious
experience, but it can hardly be said to have any deep
significance in the religious history of Rome. Of the
obliteration of the old <i>numen</i> Neptunus by the Greek
god who took his name we know nothing for good or ill;
we are ignorant of the real meaning of the old <i>numen</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>and cannot tell whether the loss of him was compensated
by the usefulness of his name in Roman literature to
represent the Greek god of the sea.</p>

<p>Let us turn to the much more important subject of the
new ceremonies ordered by the Sibylline "books." The
first authentic case of such innovation occurred in 399 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
during the long and troublesome siege of the dangerous
neighbour city Veii; I call it authentic because all the best
modern authorities so reckon it, though it occurred before
the destruction of old records during the capture of the city
by the Gauls. The circumstances were such as to fix themselves
in the memory of the people, and in one way or
another they found their way into the earliest annals,
probably those of Fabius Pictor, composed during the
Second Punic War.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">547</a></p>

<p>The previous winter, Livy tells us,<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> was one of extraordinary
severity; the roads were blocked with snow, and
navigation on the Tiber stopped by the ice. This miserable
winter was followed too suddenly by a hot season,
in which a plague broke out which consumed both man
and beast, and continued so persistently that the Senate
ordered the Sibylline books to be consulted. This persistence
is the first point we should notice; "Cuius insanabili
pernicie quando nec causa nec finis inveniebatur,"&mdash;so
wrote Livy, evidently meaning to express an extremity of
trouble which would not give way to ordinary religious
remedies. We may compare his account of the next
recorded consultation of the books (Livy vii. 2), when
neither the old rites nor even the new ones were sufficient
to secure the <i>pax deorum</i> and abate another pestilence, and
recourse was had to yet another remedy in the form of
<i>ludi scenici</i>. The times were out of joint,&mdash;the peace of
the gods was broken, and thus the community was no
longer in right relation to the Power manifesting itself in
the universe. The result was a revival of <i>religio</i>, of the
feeling of alarm and anxiety out of which the whole
religious system had grown. The old deities might seem
to be forsaking their functions, since the old rites had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>ceased to appeal to them. Mysterious and persistent
pestilence is a great tamer of human courage; it is a new
experience that man knows not how to meet, and in
ancient life it was also a new <i>religious</i> experience.</p>

<p>The remedy was as new as the pestilence, and almost
as pernicious. During eight days Rome saw three pairs
of deities reclining in the form of images on couches,
before which were spread tables covered with food and
drink. Whether in this first case they were taken out of
the temples and exposed to view in certain places, <i>e.g.</i>
the forum, is not clear; later on, in the days of <i>supplicationes</i>,
of which more will be said presently, they were
visited in procession. The three pairs were Apollo and
Latona, Diana and Hercules, Mercurius and Neptunus;
all of them Greek, or, as in the case of Diana, Mercurius,
and Neptunus, Roman deities in their new Greek form.
We cannot trace the special applicability of all of them
to the trouble they were thus invoked to appease,&mdash;another
point that suggests a complete revolution in the Roman
ways of contemplating divine beings. These are not
functional <i>numina</i>, but foreigners whose ways were only
known to the manipulators of the Sibylline utterances.
They seem like quack remedies, of which the action is
unknown to the consumer.</p>

<p>New also, but better in its effect, was the publicity of
these proceedings, and the part taken in them by the
whole population, patrician and plebeian, men, women,
and children. If we can trust Livy's further statements,
every one left his door open and kept open house, inviting
all to come in, whether known or unknown; all old
quarrels were made up, and no new ones suffered to
begin; prisoners were freed from their chains, and
universal good-will prevailed. These eight days were in
fact kept as holidays, and doubtless by the novelty of
the whole scene the astute authorities hoped to inspire
fresh hope and confidence, and to divert attention from
the prevailing misery, just as our soldiers in India are
induced to forget the presence of cholera in a station by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>constant games and amusements. That this was really
one leading object of the whole show is not generally
recognised by historians; but it seems fully explained by
the fact I mentioned just now, that in the similar trouble
of 349 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> recourse was had for the first time to <i>ludi
scenici</i> in order to amuse the people. In the history of
the Hannibalic war we shall have plenty of opportunity
of noting this kind of expedient. The Roman people,
we must remember, were getting more and more to be
inhabitants of a large city, and, as such, to seek for entertainment,
like all citizens in all ages. The religious rites
of the old calendar were perhaps by this time getting too
familiar, losing their original meaning; whether they had
ever been very entertaining to a city population may be
doubted. Something more showy was needed; processions
had always been to the taste of the Roman,
and banquets, such as the epulum Iovis, which I have
already noticed, often accompanied the processions.</p>

<p>Now, this love of show and novelty, of which we
have abundant evidence later on as a Roman characteristic,
taken together with the anxiety and alarm&mdash;the
new <i>religio</i>&mdash;arising from the pestilence, will sufficiently
explain the <i>lectisternia</i>, as these shows were called. We
have here in fact the first appearance, constantly recurring
in later Roman history, of a tendency to seek not only
for novelty, but for a more emotional expression of
religious feeling than was afforded by the old forms of
sacrifice and prayer, conducted as they were by the priest
on behalf of the community without its active participation.
Those old forms might do for the old patrician
community of farmers and warriors, but not so well for
the new and ever-increasing population of artisans and
other workmen, whether of Roman or foreign descent.
It would seem, indeed, as if the sensitiveness of the
human fibre of a primitive community increases with its
increasing complexity, and with the greater variety of
experience to which it is exposed; and in the case of
Rome, as if the simple ancient methods of dealing with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>the divine inhabitants of the city were no longer adequate
to the needs of a State which was steering its way to
empire among so many difficulties and perils. It is not
indeed certain that the new rites, or some points in them,
may not have had their prototypes in old Italian usage,
though the <i>lectisternia</i>, the actual display of gods in
human form and in need of food like human beings, are
almost certainly Greek in origin.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">549</a> But so far as we can
guess, the emotional element was wholly new. True,
Livy tells us in two passages of his third book of
occasions when men, women, and children flocked to all
the shrines (<i>omnia delubra</i>) seeking for the <i>pax deorum</i>
at the invitation of the senate; but the early date, the
great improbability of the senate taking any such step,
and the absence of any mention of the priesthoods, makes
it difficult to believe that these assertions are based
on any genuine record. We must be content to mark
the first <i>lectisternia</i> in 399 as the earliest authentic
example of the emotional tendency of the Roman plebs.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">550</a></p>

<p>If we can judge of this period of Roman religious
history by the general tendency of the policy of the
Roman government, we may see here a deliberate attempt
to include the new population in worship of a kind that
would calm its fears, engage its attention, and satisfy its
emotion, while leaving uncontaminated the old ritual that
had served the State so long. If this conclusion be a
right one, then we must allow that the new ceremonial
had its use. Dr. Frazer has lately told us in his eloquent
and persuasive way, of how much value superstition has
been in building up moral habits and the instinct of submission
to civil order. His thesis might be illustrated
adequately from the history of Rome alone. But from a
purely religious point of view the story of the <i>lectisternia</i>
is a sad one. The old Roman invisible <i>numen</i>, working
with force in a particular department of human life and
its environment, was a far nobler mental conception, and
far more likely to grow into a power for good, than the
miserable images of Graeco-Roman full-blown gods and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>goddesses reclining on their couches and appearing to
partake of dinner like a human citizen. Such ideas of
the divine must have forced men's religious ideas clean
away from the Power manifesting itself in the universe,
and must have dragged down the Roman <i>numina</i> with
them in their corrupting degradation. According to our
definition of it, religion was now in a fair way to disappear
altogether; what was destined to take its place
was not really religion at all. Nor did it in any way
assist the growth of an individual conscience, as perhaps
did some of the later religious forms introduced from
without. It was of value for the moment to the State, in
satisfying a population greatly disturbed by untoward
events; and that was all.</p>

<p>Closely connected with the <i>lectisternia</i>, and following
close upon them in chronological order, were the processional
ceremonies called <i>supplicationes</i>. The historical
relation between the two is by no means clear; but if we
conclude, as I am fairly sure we may, that the <i>lectisternia</i>
were shows of a joyful character, accompanied, as Livy
describes the first one, with private entertainments, and
meant to keep up the spirits of the plebeian population,
and if we then turn to the early <i>supplicationes</i>, in which
men, women, and children, <i>coronati</i>, and carrying laurel
branches, went in procession to the temples, and there
prostrated themselves after the Greek fashion, the women
"crinibus passis aras verrentes," we shall be disposed to
look on them as, in origin at least, distinct from each
other.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">551</a> We may conjecture that the appearance of the
gods in human form at the doors of their temples suggested
to the plebeian women a kind of emotional worship
which was alien to the old Roman feeling, but familiar
enough to those (and they must have been many) who
knew the life of the Greek cities of Italy. It may be
that they had tried it even in earlier times; but anyhow,
in the fourth and third centuries <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> advantage was taken
of the <i>pulvinaria</i> to use them as stopping-places in the
procession of a <i>supplicatio</i>, and the phrase becomes a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>common one in the annals, "supplicatio ad omnia pulvinaria
indicta." The <i>lectisternia</i> were ordered five times in the
fourth century;<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">552</a> by that time, it would seem likely, the
<i>supplicationes</i> had become an authorised institution, and
had perhaps embodied the practice of <i>lectisternia</i> in the
way suggested above. We shall meet with them again
when we come to the religious history of the war with
Hannibal.</p>

<p>One word more before I leave this subject for the
present. In all this innovation we must not forget to
note the growth of individual feeling as distinguished
from the old worship of civic grouping, in which the
individual, as such, was of little or no account. I pointed
out the first signs of this individualism when speaking of
the temple of the Capitoline Jupiter, and we shall have
reason to mark its rapid growth further. We are now, in
fact, and must realise that we are, in a period in which,
throughout the Graeco-Roman world, the need was beginning
to be felt of some new rule of individualistic morality.
The Roman population, now recruited from many sources,
was but reflecting this need unconsciously when it insisted
on new emotional rites and expiations. The Roman authorities
were forced to satisfy the demand; but in doing so
they made no real contribution to the history of Roman
religious experience. It was impossible that they should do
so; they represented the old civic form of religion, "bound
up with the life of a society, and unable to contemplate
the individual except as a member of it."<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">553</a> The new
forms of worship, the <i>supplicatio</i> and <i>lectisternium</i>, could
not be, as the old forms had in some sense been, the consecration
of civic and national life. They were to the
Romans as the worship of Baal to the Jews of the time
of the Kings; and, unlike that poisonous cult, they could
never be rooted out.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">554</a><a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">555</a></p>

oldest Apolline fanum in Rome (outside pomoerium), is unknown;
that of the temple on the same site was 431 (Livy iv. 25 and 29).
There is little doubt that the Apollo-cult spread from Cumae northwards,
and was by this time well established in Italy. (The foundation

<h4>LECTURE XII</h4>

<h5>THE PONTIFICES AND THE SECULARISATION OF
RELIGION</h5>


<p>In the last lecture we saw how the new experiences of
the Roman people, during the period from the abolition
of the kingship to the war with Hannibal, led to the introduction
of foreign deities and showy ceremonies of a
character quite strange to the old religion. But there
was another process going on at the same time. The
authorities of that old religion were full of vigour in this
same period; it may even be said, that as far as we can
trace their activity in the dim light of those early days,
they made themselves almost supreme in the State.
And the result was, in brief, that religion became more
and more a matter of State administration, and thereby
lost its chance of developing the conscience of the individual.
It is indeed quite possible, as has recently been
maintained,<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">556</a> that it stood actively in the way of such
development. I have no doubt that there was a germ of
conscience, of moral feeling, in the <i>religio</i> of old days&mdash;the
feeling of anxiety and doubt which originally suggested
the <i>cura</i> and <i>caerimonia</i> of the State; but the efforts of the
authorities in this period were spent in gradually destroying
that germ. True, they did not interfere with the
simple religion of the family, which had its value all
through Roman history; but the attitude of the individual
towards public worship will react on his attitude towards
private worship, which may also have lost some part of
its vitality in this period.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>The religious authorities of which I speak are of course
the two great colleges of pontifices and augurs. Of the
latter, and of the system of divination of which they held
the secrets, I will speak in the next lecture. Here we
have to do with the pontifices and their work in this
period, a thorny and somewhat technical subject, but a
most important one for the history of Roman religious
experience.</p>

<p>I have so far assumed that this college existed in the age
of the kings, and assisted the Rex in the administration
of the <i>ius divinum</i>. It is legitimate to do this, but as a
matter of fact we do not know for certain what was the
origin of the college itself, or of its mysterious name. In
the period we have now reached we come, however, upon
a striking fact, which is luckily easy to interpret; the
king's house, the <i>Regia</i>, has become the office of the head
of the college, the pontifex maximus, and also the meeting-place
of the college for business.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">557</a> Obviously this head,
whether or no he existed during the kingly period, has
stepped into the place of the Rex in the control of the
<i>ius divinum</i>. Again, we know that in the third century
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, when written history begins, the pontifices and their
head had reached a very high level of power, as we shall
presently see more in detail; the process of the growth
of this power must therefore lie in the two preceding
centuries, during which Rome was slowly attaining that
paramount position in Italy in which we find her at the
time of the Punic wars. Thirdly, we know that in that
third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> the college was laid open to plebeians as
well as to members of the old patrician gentes, and that
one of the most famous of all its many distinguished
heads was not only not a patrician, but a Latin from
Cameria, Ti. Coruncanius. Putting these three facts together
we can divine in outline the history of the pontifices
during these two centuries. With the instinct for order
and organisation that never failed them, the Romans have
constructed a <i>permanent</i> power to take charge of their <i>ius
divinum</i>, <i>i.e.</i> all their relations to the deities with whom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>they must maintain a <i>pax</i>; the circumstances of their
career during two centuries have exalted this power to
an extraordinary degree of influence, direct and indirect,
internal and external; and, lastly, in a period which
saw the gradual amalgamation into a unified whole of
privileged and unprivileged, <i>patres</i> and <i>plebs</i>, they have
with wonderful wisdom thrown open to all citizens the
administration of that <i>ius</i> which was essential to the
welfare of the united community. These are indisputable
facts; and they are thoroughly characteristic of the
practical wisdom of the Roman people in that early age.</p>

<p>In order to understand how the pontifices attained their
great position, the one thing needful is to examine the
nature of their work. This I propose to do next, and
then to attempt to sum up the result of their activity on
the Roman religious system.</p>

<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of the
college in the early history of Roman law; and for us in
particular that importance lies in the fact that they were
the sole depositaries of the religious law in the period
during which the civil law was being slowly disentangled
from it. If we look at the so-called <i>leges regiae</i>, which
are probably the oldest rules of law that have come down
to us (though they may have been made into a collection
as late as the very end of the Republic),<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">558</a> we see at once
that they belong to the <i>ius divinum</i>; and there is little
doubt that they were extracted from those books of the
pontifices which I shall have to explain later on.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> In
other words, it is the maintenance of the <i>pax deorum</i> that
they are chiefly concerned with; the crime of the citizen
is a violation of that <i>pax</i>, and the deity most concerned
will punish the community unless some expiatory step is
taken to re-establish the right relation between the human
and divine inhabitants of the city. "Pellex aram Iunonis
ne tangito; si tanget, Iunoni crinibus demissis agnum
feminam caedito." "Si parentem puer verberit, ast olle
plorassit, puer divis parentum sacer esto."<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> The harlot
who touches the altar of Juno, the deity of married women,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>breaks the <i>pax</i> with that deity, and she must offer a
piacular sacrifice to renew it; the son who strikes a
parent is made over as the property of the <i>divi parentum</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> those of the whole community,<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">561</a> the peaceful relation
with whom his act has imperilled. With such rules
as these the civil magistrate of the republic can have had
nothing to do; they belong to an older period of thought
and of government, and survived in the books of the
college which under the republic continued to administer
the <i>ius divinum</i>; for these rules doubtless continued to
exist side by side with the civil law as it gradually
developed itself, and the necessary modes of expiation
were known to the pontifices only. Roman society was
indeed so deeply penetrated for many ages with the idea
of <i>religio</i>&mdash;the dread of violating the <i>pax deorum</i>,&mdash;that the
idea of law as a matter of the relation of man to man, as
"the interference of the State in the passions and interests
of humanity only," must have gained ground by very
slow degrees. This primitive religious law then, <i>i.e.</i> the
regulation of the proper steps to be taken to avoid a
breach of the <i>pax deorum</i>, was entirely in the hands of the
religious authorities, the Rex at first and then the
pontifices, as the only experts who could know the secrets
of the <i>ius divinum</i>; and from their decisions and prescriptions
there could be no appeal, simply because there
was no individual or body in the State to whom an
appeal was conceivable. But after the rule of the
Etruscan kings, with all its disturbing influences, and
after the revolution which got rid of them, there must
have been an age of new ideas and increased mental
activity, and also of increasing social complexity, the
signs of which in the way of trade and industry we have
already found in certain facts of religious history. In
the domain of law this meant new problems, new difficulties;
and these were met in the middle of the fifth
century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, if the received chronology is to be accepted,<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">562</a>
by the publication of the XII. Tables.</p>

<p>In order to get some idea of the work of the pontifices
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>at this time, let us consider one or two of these difficulties
and problems.</p>

<p>Within the family every act, every relation, was matter
of religion; the <i>numina</i> had to be considered in regard
to it. The end and aim, then as throughout Roman
history, was the maintenance of the <i>sacra</i> of the family,
without which it could not be conceived as existing&mdash;the
due worship of its deities, and the religious care of its
dead. Take marriage as an example: "the entry of a
bride into the household&mdash;of one who as yet had no lot
in the family life&mdash;meant some straining of the relation
between the divine and human members,"<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">563</a> and the
human part of the family must be assured that the
divine part is willing to accept her before the step can be
regarded as complete. She has to enter the family in
such a way as to share in its <i>sacra</i>; and if <i>confarreatio</i>
was (as we may believe) the oldest form of patrician
marriage,<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> the bride was subjected to a ceremony which
was plainly of a sacramental character&mdash;the sacred cake
of <i>far</i> being partaken of by both bride and bridegroom
in the presence of the highest religious authority of the
State. In the simplest form of society there would be
no call for further priestly interference in marriage; but
in a society growing more numerous and complex, exceptions,
abnormal conditions begin to show themselves,
and new problems arise, which must be solved by new
expedients, prescriptions, permissions, devices, or fictions.
For these the religious authorities are solely responsible;
for what is a matter of religious interest to the family is
also matter of religious interest to the State, simply because
the State is composed of families in the same sense
as the human body is composed of cellular tissue. All
this, we believe, was once the work of the Rex, perhaps
with the college of pontifices to help him; when the kingship
disappeared it became the work of that college solely,
with the pontifex maximus as the chief authority.</p>

<p>So, too, in all other questions which concerned the
maintenance of the family, and especially in regard to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>devolution of property. I am here only illustrating the
way in which the pontifical college acquired their paramount
influence by having a quantity of new and difficult
work forced upon them, and it is not part of my plan to
explain the early history of adoptions and wills; but I
may give a single concrete illustration for the benefit of
those who are not versed in Roman law. It must constantly
have happened, in that disturbed period which brought
the kingship to an end, that by death or capture in war a
family was left without male heirs. Daughters could
not take their place, because the <i>sacra</i> of a family could
not be maintained by daughters, who would, in the natural
order of things, be sooner or later married and so become
members of other families. Hence the expedient was
adopted of making a <i>filius familias</i> of another family a
member of your own; and this, like marriage, involved a
straining of the relations between the human and divine
members of your family, and was thus a matter for the
religious authorities to contrive in such a manner as to
preserve the <i>pax</i> between them. The difficulty was overcome
by the practical wisdom of the pontifical college,
which held a solemn inquiry into the case before submitting
it to the people in specially summoned assembly
(<i>comitia calata</i>);<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">565</a> and thus the new <i>filius familias</i> was
enabled not only to renounce his own <i>sacra</i> (<i>detestatio
sacrorum</i>), but to pass into the guardianship of another
set of <i>sacra</i>, without incurring the anger of the <i>numina</i>
concerned with the welfare of either.</p>

<p>Such difficult matters as these, and many more connected
directly or indirectly with the devolution of property,
such as the guardianship of women and of the
incapable, the power to dispose of property otherwise than
by the original rules of succession, the law of burial and
the care of the dead,&mdash;all these, at the time of which I am
speaking, must have been among the secrets of the pontifices;
and we can also suspect, though without being
sure of our facts, that the great increase of the importance
of the <i>plebs</i> under the Etruscan dynasty offered further
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>opportunities for the growth alike of the work and influence
of the college.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">566</a> Above all, we must remember that
this work was done in secret, that the mysteries of adjustment
were unknown to the people when once they had
passed out of the ken of family and gens, and that there
could have been no appeal from the pontifices to any
other body. Nay, more, we must also bear in mind that
this body of religious experts was <i>self-electing</i>. Until the
lex Domitia of 104 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> both pontifices and augurs filled
up their own colleges with persons whom they believed
qualified both by knowledge and disposition. Thus it
would seem that there was every chance that in that early
Rome, where neither in family nor State could anything
be undertaken without some reference to the religious
authority, where the <i>pax deorum</i> was the one essential object
of public and private life, a power might be developed
apt one day not only to petrify religion and stultify its
worshippers, but thereby also to cramp the energies of
the community, acting as an obstacle to its development
within its walls and without. Had Roman law remained
entirely in the hands of this self-electing college, one
of two things must have happened: either that college
would have become purely secular in character, or the
wonderful legal system that we still enjoy would never
have had space to grow up. But this was not to be;
with the publication of the XII. Tables a new era opens.</p>

<p>If we reject, as we conscientiously may, the latest
attempts of criticism to post-date the drawing up of the
Tables,<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">567</a> and in fact to destroy their historical value for
us, what is their significance for our present purpose?
It is simply that in the middle of the fifth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> the
pontifices lost a monopoly&mdash;ceased to be the sole depositaries
of the rules of law affecting the <i>pax deorum</i>, and that
new rules are being set down in writing, on the basis of
old custom, which more especially affect the relations
between the human citizens. For both the <i>ius divinum</i>
and the <i>ius civile</i> are to be found in this collection, but
the latter is beginning to assert its independence. I think
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>we may say, without much hesitation, that this event,
however doubtful its traditional details, did actually save
Rome from either of the two consequences to which I
alluded just now. The constitution developed itself on
lay and not on ecclesiastical lines, leaving the pontifices
other work to do, and Roman civil law was eventually
able to free itself from the trammels of the <i>ius divinum</i>.</p>

<p>But for another century the college still found abundant
legal work to do, for it was not likely that at Rome, the
most conservative of all city-states, it could be quickly
set aside, or that the old ideas of law could so speedily
disappear. What then was this work?</p>

<p>When rules of civil law were written down, it was still
necessary to deal with them in two ways which were open to
the pontifices, and indeed at this early time to no one else.
First, it was necessary to make their provisions effectual
by prescribing in each case the proper method of procedure
(<i>actio</i>). Now it is most important to grasp the
fact that procedure in the <i>ius civile</i> was originally of precisely
the same nature as procedure in the <i>ius divinum</i>,
and that precisely the same rigid exactness is indispensable
in both. Action and formula in civil law belong to the same
class of practices as sacrifice and prayer in religious law,
and spring from the same mental soil. Thus, for example,
the most familiar case of action and formula in civil law,
the <i>sacramentum</i>, was, as the name proves, a piece of
religious procedure, <i>i.e.</i> the deposition in a sacred spot of
a sum of money which the suitor in the case would forfeit if
he lost it, together with the utterance of a certain formula
of words which must be correctly spoken. If we choose
to go back so far, we may even see in this combination
of formularised act and speech a survival of magical or
quasi-magical belief;<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> but this is matter rather for the anthropologist
than the historian of religion. The point for
us at this moment is that these acts and formulae (<i>legis
actiones</i>, as they are known in Roman law) could not
suddenly or rapidly pass out of the hands of that body of
skilled experts which had so long been in sole possession
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>of them; the publication of old and new rules of law in
the XII. Tables made no immediate difference in this
respect. The consuls, the new civil executive, were still
in no sense necessarily skilled in such matters, and were
without the prestige of the former executive, the Rex;
they were also doubtless busy with other work, especially
in the field. Nothing could be more natural than that
the pontifices should continue to provide the procedure
for the now written law, just as they had formerly supplied
it for the unwritten.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">569</a></p>

<p>So, too, with the <i>interpretation</i> of the Tables; this was
the second part of the work that still remained to them.
Writing was in that age a mystery to the mass of the
population, and doubtless the idea was still in their minds
that there was something supernatural about it. Writing,
in fact, as well as formularised action and speech, may have
had the flavour of magic about it. However that may be,
there can be no doubt that the interpretation of a legal
document was in those days a much more serious, if a less
arduous business, than it is now. Here again, then, it
seems perfectly natural that there should be no rapid or
violent change in the <i>personnel</i> of those deemed capable
of such interpretation; there was no other body of experts
capable of the work; the pontifices remained <i>iuris-consulti</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> interpreters and advisers, and in the course
of two and a half centuries accumulated an amount of
material that formed a basis for the first published system
of Roman law, the <i>ius Aelianum</i> or <i>tripartita</i> of 200 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
It is most useful to remember, as proof of this, that one
member of the college was selected every year for the
special purpose of helping the people with advice in
matters of civil law, both in regard to interpretation and
the choice of <i>legis actiones</i>; so we are expressly told
by Pomponius, who adds that this practice continued for
about a hundred years after the publication of the Tables,
<i>i.e.</i> till the election of the first praetor in 366.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> After
that date the <i>ius civile</i> emerges more distinctly from the
old body of law, which included also the <i>ius divinum</i>, and its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>interpretation was no longer a matter purely for religious
experts. In 337 we hear of the first <i>plebeian</i> praetor&mdash;truly
a momentous event, showing that the old profound
belief is dying out, which demanded a religious and patrician
qualification for all legal work. And at the end of
the fourth century comes the publication, not only of the
<i>legis actiones</i>, but of the Fasti, <i>i.e.</i> even of that most
vital part of the <i>ius divinum</i>, which distinguished the
times and seasons belonging to the numina from those
belonging to the human citizens.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">571</a> One might well suppose
that the power of the pontifices was on the wane, for they
had lost another monopoly.</p>

<p>And indeed in one sense this was so. It must have
been so, for as the range of the State's activity increased,
the sphere of religious influence became relatively less.
Marriage, for example, though it still needed a religious
ceremony in common opinion, ceased to need it in the eye
of the law&mdash;a change which is familiar to us in our own
age. The pontifex was no longer indispensable to the
suitor at law, nor to the citizen who wished to know on
what day he might proceed with his suit. The college
undoubtedly ceased to be the powerful secretly-acting body
in whose hands was the entire <i>religio</i> of the citizen, <i>i.e.</i>
the decision of all points on which he might feel the old
anxious nervousness about the good-will of the gods.
But now we mark a change which gave the old institution
new life and new work. At the end of this fourth century
(300 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) it was thrown open to plebeians by the lex
Ogulnia; and, as I have already mentioned, within a few
years we come upon a plebeian pontifex maximus, who
was not even a Roman by birth, yet one of the most
famous in the whole series of the holders of that great
office. Most probably, too, the numbers of the members
have already been increased from five to nine, of whom
five must be plebeian. These members begin to be
found holding also civil magistracies, and the pontifex
maximus was often a consul of the year. It is quite
plain then that this priestly office is becoming more and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>more secularised; it expands with the new order of things
instead of shrinking into itself. It leaves religion, in the
proper sense of the word, far behind. The sacrificing
priests, the flamines, etc., who were the humbler members
in a technical sense of the same college, go on with their
proper and strictly religious work under the supervision
of the pontifex maximus,<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">572</a> but they steadily become of
less importance as the greater members become secularised
in their functions and their ambitions. And these greater
members, instead of becoming stranded on a barren shore
of antique religion, boldly venture into a new sphere of
human life, and add definite secular work to their old
religious functions.</p>

<p>The events of the latter part of the fourth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
culminating in the publication of the Fasti and the <i>legis
actiones</i>, probably meant much more for the Romans than
we can divine by the uncertain light of historical imagination.
It is the age of expansion, internal and external;
the old patrician exclusive rule was gone beyond recall;
the plebeians had forced their way into every department
of government, including at last even the great religious
<i>collegia</i>; the old Latin league had been broken up, and
the Latin cities organised in various new relations to
Rome, each one being connected with the suzerain city
by a separate treaty, sealed with religious sanctions. After
the Samnite wars and the struggle with Pyrrhus, further
organisation was necessary, and there arose by degrees a
loose system of union which we are accustomed to call
the Italian confederation. The adaptation of all these
new conditions to the existing order of things at Rome
was the work of the senate and magistrates so far as it
concerned human beings only; but so far as it affected the
relations of the divine inhabitants of the various communities
it must have been the work of the pontifices.
That work is indeed almost entirely hidden from us, for
Livy's books of this period are lost, and Livy is the only
historian who has preserved for us in any substance the
religious side of Rome's public life. But what we have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>learnt in the course of these lectures will have made it plain
that no political changes could take place without involving
religious adaptation, and also that the only body qualified
to undertake such adaptation was the pontifical college.</p>

<p>We may thus be quite certain, that though they had
lost their old monopoly of religious knowledge, the pontifices
found plenty of fresh work to do in this period.
It is my belief that they now became more active than
they ever had been. From this time, for example, we
may almost certainly date their literary or quasi-literary
activity; I mean the practice of recording the leading
events of each year, which may have had its origin a
century earlier, with the eclipse of the sun in or about
404 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> I should guess that after the admission of the
plebeians to the college in 300 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, the new members put
fresh life and vigour into the old work, and developed it
in various directions. It is in this period that I am
inclined to attribute to the college that zeal for compiling
and perhaps inventing religious formulae of all kinds,
which took shape in the <i>libri</i> or <i>commentarii pontificum</i>,
and embodied that strange manual of the methods of
addressing deities, which we know as <i>Indigitamenta</i>. And
again, in the skilled work of the admission of new deities
and the dedication of their temples, occasioned by the
new organisation and condition of Italy, and lastly, in the
supervision of the proper methods of expiating <i>prodigia</i>,
which (though the habit is doubtless an old one) began
henceforward to be reported to the Senate from all parts
of the ager Romanus and even beyond, their meetings in
the Regia must have been fully occupied. Our loss is
great indeed in the total want of detail about the life
and character of the great plebeian pontifex maximus
of the first half of the third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, that Titus
Coruncanius whom I have already mentioned as being a
Latin by birth; for Cicero declares that the <i>commentarii</i>
of the college showed him as a man of the greatest
ability,<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">574</a> whose reputation remained for ages as one who
was ready with wise counsel in matters both public and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>private. Coupling him with two other memorable holders
of the office, he says that "et in senatu et apud populum
et in causis amicorum et domi et militiae consilium suum
fidemque praestabant."<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">575</a> This passage should be remembered
as a valuable illustration of the way in which
the college and its head were becoming more and more
occupied with secular business; it is worth noting, too,
that this great man was himself consul in the year 280,
and took a useful part in the first campaign against
Pyrrhus.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">576</a> Yet Cicero makes it plain that he looked on
him also as a great figure in religious matters&mdash;nay, even
as a man whom the gods loved.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">577</a></p>

<p>I will finish this lecture by illustrating briefly this
renewed and extended activity of the pontifices, so far as
we can dimly trace it in this third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Most of
it is connected more or less directly with the State religion,
yet with a tendency to become more and more secular
and perfunctory; the word <i>cura</i> would express it better
than <i>caerimonia</i>, and <i>caerimonia</i> better than <i>religio</i>. The
care of the calendar, for example (a technical matter
which lies outside my province in these lectures), was
originally of religious importance, because the oldest
religious festivals marked operations of husbandry, and
these, when fixed in the calendar, must occur at the right
seasons.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">578</a> It was the duty of the pontifices so to adjust
the necessary intercalations as to effect this object&mdash;a
duty to which they were, as it turned out, quite unequal.
But continued city life broke the connection between the
festivals and the agricultural work to which they originally
corresponded, and what was once a <i>cura</i> of religious import
became a secular matter of which the value was not appreciated.
So too with another duty, for which both the
Romans and ourselves have more reason to be grateful to
them&mdash;the recording of the leading events of national
history.</p>

<p>It is uncertain what prompted the college, or rather
its head, to begin making these records, though there is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>no doubt about the fact. But it would be natural enough
that those who had charge of the calendar, which would
necessitate some record of years for purposes of intercalation,
should go on to mark the names of the consuls
and such striking events as would make a year memorable.
In any case this was what actually happened. The
pontifex maximus, we are told with precision, kept a
<i>tabula</i>, or whited board, on which these events were noted
down, with the consuls' names attached to them, or possibly
a kind of almanac, made out for the whole year, on
which they could append their notes to particular days.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">579</a>
This yearly <i>tabula</i> was no doubt at first kept secret, like
all the pontifical documents, but sooner or later, perhaps
at the same time as the publication of the <i>fasti</i> and <i>legis
actiones</i>, it was exposed to public view in or at the Regia.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">580</a>
This went on for at least two centuries, and the records,
which in the nature of things must have grown in length
and detail as events became more startling and numerous,
were edited in eighty books by the pontifex maximus P.
Mucius Scaevola in 123 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>&mdash;the year of the first
tribunate of C. Gracchus. The large number of these
books has long been a stumbling-block to the learned,
for we are expressly told that the <i>annales maximi</i>, as the
records were called, were (in spite of their name) of a
very meagre character; and many conjectures have quite
recently been made to explain it.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">581</a> But guessing is almost
useless, seeing that there are no data for it. The editor
may have added matter of his own, amplifying and
adorning after the manner of writers of his day; or he
may have worked in the contents of other pontifical books,
<i>libri</i> or <i>commentarii pontificales</i>. The point for us is simply
the continued activity of the pontifex maximus in this
work, which must have become almost entirely secular in
character. The notes may have been jejune, but they
were probably accurate, and free from the perversions of
family vanity or such lengthy rhetorical ornamentation as
became the universal fashion among private writers of
annalistic history. They were, we may suppose, exactly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>what our modern historical conscience demands. But all
that is left of them, or almost all, is the list of consuls
(<i>fasti consulares</i>) and of triumphs (<i>fasti triumphales</i>) which
in their present form must, or at least may, have been
extracted from them.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">582</a> On the whole, we may reckon
them as the most valuable work of the college; and they
may be taken as marking a growing sense of the importance
of Rome and her history, the commemoration
of which is thus committed to an official who, as an
individual, had invariably served the State well, and in
whom all classes had perfect confidence.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">583</a></p>

<p>One important part of the work of the college in this
century must have been the adjustment of the civic religion
of the Italian communities to that of Rome. What
deities were to be made citizens of Rome? Which were
to be left in their old homes undisturbed? No doubt
many other questions must have called for attention in
religious matters after the conquest of Italy, but this is
the one of which we know most. The temple foundations
of this period have all been carefully put together (chiefly
from Livy's invaluable records) by Aust,<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> and show that
there was a certain tendency to bring in deities from
outside, not so much because they represented some
special need of the Romans, corn or art or industry, as
two centuries earlier, but simply because they were deities
of the conquered whom it might be prudent to adopt.
The great Juno Regina of Veii was long ago induced by
<i>evocatio</i> to migrate to Rome; Fors Fortuna from Etruria,
Juturna from Lavinium, Minerva Capta from Falerii,
Feronia, a famous Latin goddess from Capena, Vortumnus
from Volsinii,<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">585</a> all attest the same liberal tone in religious
matters which on the whole marks the secular Italian
policy of the Senate in this period. If we had but more
information about the former, we should be able to understand
the latter far better. We should like to know why
in some cases the chief deity of a community came to
Rome, while in others there is not trace of migration.
The famous Vacuna of Reate, for example, never left her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>home in the Apennines, possibly because she was a kind
of Vesta, who could not be spared from Reate, and was
not wanted at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">586</a></p>

<p>The list of foundations also points to other tendencies
and experiences of the time. We might guess that there
was some attempt, with the aid of pontifical skill, to
encourage agriculture or give it a fresh start after the
invasion of Pyrrhus; for between 272 and 264, the years
of the pacification of Italy, we find temples built to four
agricultural deities, three indigenous Roman ones, Consus,
Tellus, Pales, and one Etruscan garden god, Vertumnus.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">587</a>
Then we have a group of foundations in honour of deities
connected with water&mdash;Juturna, Fons, Tempestates, which
seem to have some reference to the naval activity of the
first Punic war; they all fall between 259 and 241 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">588</a>
Lastly, we notice a fresh accession of deified abstractions,&mdash;Salus
(an old deity in a new form), Spes, Honos et
Virtus, Concordia, and Mens.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">589</a> I am glad to find that
the latest investigator of these religious abstractions is
at one with me in believing that they simply mark a
developed stage in the religious bent of the earliest
Roman. If the old Romans had the habit of spiritualising
a great variety of material objects, in other words,
if they were in an advanced animistic stage, there seems
to be no reason why they should not have begun to
spiritualise mental concepts also (for which they had
words, as for the material objects), even at a very early
period. The whole psychological aspect of such abstractions
is most interesting, but I must pass it over
here, merely suggesting that each of these abstractions
was doubtless deified for some particular reason, under
the direction, or with the sanction, of the pontifices.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">590</a></p>

<p>But we have not as yet reached what is, after all, for
our purposes the most instructive part of the work of the
pontifices&mdash;I mean the archives or memoranda (<i>libri</i> or
<i>commentarii</i>) which they kept, and from which, indirectly,
much of what I have had to say about the <i>ius
divinum</i> has been drawn. It is here that we see the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>policy of maintaining the <i>pax deorum</i> carried to its highest
point. These books contained a vast collection of
formulae for every kind of process in which the deities
were in any way concerned; here was the complete
<i>pharmacopoeia</i> of the <i>ius divinum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> We must remember
that the pontifex maximus and his assessors had to be
ready at any moment with the correct formula for all
religious acts, whether extraordinary, like the <i>devotio</i> of
Decius or the expiation of some startling "prodigium,"
or belonging to the ordinary course of city life, such as
prayers in sacrificial ritual, <i>vota</i> both public and private,
charters (<i>leges</i>) of newly founded temples, and so on.
The idea that the spoken formula (ultimately, as we saw,
derived from an age of magic) was efficient only if no
slip were made, seems to have gained in strength instead
of diminishing, as we might have expected it to do with
advancing civilisation; and the pontifices not only responded
to its importunity, but actually stimulated it.
<i>Vires acquirit eundo</i> are words which apply well in all
ages to the passion for organisation and precision. Though
we cannot prove it, I myself have little doubt that the
members of the college, or some of them, collected and
invented formulae simply for the pleasure of doing it,
and that the work became as congenial to them as the
systematisation of the law to Jewish scribes after the
captivity, or as casuistry to the confessors of the middle
ages. When the art of writing became familiar to experts,
the natural and primitive desire of the Roman to have
exactness in the spoken word affected him also in his
relations with the word as written. The scribe and the
Pharisee found their opportunity. The whole public
religion of the State, and to some extent also the private
religion of the family, became a mass of forms and
formulae, and never succeeded in freeing itself from these
fetters.</p>

<p>We can best illustrate this superfluity of priestly zeal
in that strange list of forms of invocation called <i>Indigitamenta</i>,
which I have already explained with the help of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>Wissowa.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">592</a> Working upon the old Roman animism,
and the popular fondness for formulae, the pontifices
drew up those lists in the fourth and third centuries
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, which have so seriously misled scholars as to the
genuine primitive religious ideas of the Romans. They
are in the main priestly inventions, the work of ingenious
formulators. We may even be tempted to look on them
as an attempt to rivet the yoke of priestly formalism on
the life of the individual as well as on the life of the
State as a whole. But if ever this was the intention,
it was too late. A people that was beginning to get
into touch with the civilisation of Hellas could not possibly
bear such a yoke. In the last lecture we have already
seen a tendency towards emotional religion independent
of the old State worship; the philosophy of individualism
was to complete the work of emancipation in
the last two centuries <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The old State religion remained,
but in stunted form and with paralysed vitality;
Rome was the scene of an <i>arrested religious development</i>.
The feeling, the religious instinct (<i>religio</i>) was indeed
there, though latent; the Romans were human beings,
like the rest of us. But as we go on with the story we
shall find that, when trouble or disaster brought it out of
its hiding-place, it was no longer possible to soothe it on
Roman principles or by Roman methods. These methods&mdash;in
other words, the <i>ius divinum</i> as formulated by the
authorities&mdash;had been meant to soothe it, and had indeed
so effectually lulled it to sleep, that when at last it awoke
again they had lost the power of dealing with it. When
the craving did come upon the Roman, which in time of
peril or doubt has come upon individuals and communities
in all ages, for support and comfort from the Unseen, it
had to be satisfied by giving him new gods to worship in
new ways, gods from Greece and the East, some of them
concealed under Latin names, but still aliens, not citizens
of his own State, aliens with whom he had little or
nothing in common, who had no home in his patriotic
feeling, no place in his religious experience.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">593</a> As I said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>at the beginning of the last lecture, we must not underrate
the religiousness of the Roman character, which was
never entirely lost; but the secret of its comparative uselessness
lies in this&mdash;that the natural desire to be right
with the Power manifesting itself in the universe, and to
know more of that Power, became weakened and destroyed
by an over-scrupulous attention to the means taken to
realise it, and by the introduction of foreign methods
which had no root in the mental fibre of the people,
and reflected no part of its experience. Religion was
effectually divorced from life and morality.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_556_556" id="Footnote_556_556"></a><a href="#FNanchor_556_556"><span class="label">556</span></a> See Mulder, <i>De notione conscientiae, quae et qualis fuerit
Romanis</i>, Leyden, 1908, cap. 2. On p. 56 he quotes Luthard (<i>Die
antike Ethik</i>, p. 131), who says of the Roman religion that it was
even more an affair of the State than with any other people; hence
its peculiar legal character. Though Mulder overworks his point,
his chapter (especially p. 61 foll.) is full of interest.</p></div>

<i>Studien und Andeutungen</i>, in which the nature and history of the
Regia was first really investigated, is still valuable. An excellent
short account is given by Mr. Marindin in his article in the <i>Dict. of
Antiquities</i>, ed. 2. It is now generally maintained that the Regia
in historical times was rather a building for sacred purposes than a
residence for a man and his family, and this I hold to be correct;
but it may for all that have originally been the residence of the Rex
and of the Pont. Max. when the Rex had disappeared.</p></div>

account is given of modern opinion as to the so-called <i>ius Papirianum</i>.
The main argument for the late date of the collection is that Cicero
does not seem to have known of it when he wrote the letter <i>ad Fam.</i>
ix. 21 in 46 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> This of course in no way affects the primitive

is inevitable in any case, but seems proved by the fact that one of
them, that relating to the <i>spolia opima</i>, is stated by Festus, p. 189
(<i>s.v.</i> "opima"), to have been extracted from those books.</p></div>

enter into the many disputes and difficulties which have arisen out of
the attempts of writers on Roman law to adjust legal ideas to the dim
early history of Rome. Binder, in his work <i>Die Plebs</i>, starts from
the improbable hypothesis that the plebs was the population of the
Latin part of the city as distinct from that Sabine part on the
Quirinal, which he believes to have been the only patrician body;
and he further believes that the plebs lived originally under "Mutterrecht,"
the patres under "Vaterrecht." Such a condition of society
would, of course, have greatly added to the pontifical work of religious
adjustment; it would have been more than even the pontifices could
have successfully achieved.</p></div>

in the Danielian scholiast on Virg. <i>Aen.</i> i. 373: "ita enim annales
conficiebantur. Tabulam dealbatam quotannis pontifex maximus
habuit, in qua praescriptis consulum nominibus et aliorum magistratum,
digna memoratu notare consueverat domi militiaeque terra
marique gesta per singulos dies. Cuius diligentiae annuos commentarios
in octoginta libros veteres retulerunt, eosque a pontificibus
maximis, a quibus fiebant, annales maximos appellarunt." The
explanation of the name is no doubt wrong; but all the rest of this
passage can be relied on; cp. Cic. <i>de Orat.</i> ii. 12. 52; Dion. Hal. i. 73,
74; Gell. ii. 28. 6; Cic. <i>Legg.</i> i. 2. 6. For the idea of the almanac,
see Cichorius in Pauly-Wissowa, <i>Real-Encycl.</i>, <i>s.v.</i> "annales maximi."</p></div>

found in brief in Schanz, <i>Gesch. der r&ouml;m. Lit.</i> i. 37. Perhaps the
boldest is that of Cantorelli, that the annales were constructed not
out of the tabula but out of the commentarii; but this is in conflict
with the passage in the scholiast on Virgil. To me the difficulty
does not seem overwhelming; events occurring "domi militiaeque,
terra marique," may have filled considerable space, and yet have
been meagre in the eyes of the rhetoricians of the last century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></p></div>

<h4>LECTURE XIII</h4>

<h5>THE AUGURS AND THE ART OF DIVINATION</h5>


<p>"The one great corruption to which all religion is exposed
is its separation from morality. The very strength of the
religious motive has a tendency to exclude, or disparage,
all other tendencies of the human mind, even the noblest
and best. It is against this corruption that the prophetic
order from first to last constantly protested.... Mercy
and justice, judgment and truth, repentance and goodness&mdash;not
sacrifice, not fasting, not ablutions,&mdash;is the
burden of the whole prophetic teaching of the Old
Testament."<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">594</a></p>

<p>The over-formalising, or ritualising, of any religion is
sure to bring about that result against which the Jewish
prophets protested. We saw at the end of the last lecture
how the pontifices contributed to such a result. We are
now to study the contribution of the other great college,
the augurs. For instead of developing, as did the wise
man or seer of Israel, into the mouthpiece of God in His
demand for the righteousness of man, the Roman diviner
merely assisted the pontifex in his work of robbing religion
of the idea of righteousness. Divination seems to be a
universal instinct of human nature, a perfectly natural
instinct, arising out of man's daily needs, hopes, fears;
but though it may have had the chance, even at Rome,
it never has been able, except among the Jews, to emerge
from its cramping chrysalis of magic and become a really
valuable stimulant of morality.</p>

<p>By divination I mean the various ways and methods
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>by which, in all stages of his development, man has persuaded
himself that what he is going to do or suffer will
turn out well or ill for him. It is probably judicious, with
Dr. Tylor and with the majority of recent anthropologists,
to consider it as belonging to the region of magic;<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> and
it is obvious that it affords excellent examples of that
inadequacy which characterises magical attempts to overcome
the difficulties man meets with in his struggle for
existence.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">596</a> It belongs, like other forms of magic, to a
stage in which man's idea of his relation to the Power
manifesting itself in the universe is both rude and rudimentary.
But it shares with magic the power or property
of surviving, in form at least, through the animistic stage
into that of religion, and it is largely practised at the
present day even among highly civilised peoples.</p>

<p>But I must observe, before I go on, that divination as
an object of anthropological inquiry still stands in need of
a thorough scientific examination. At present it seems
to puzzle anthropologists;<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">597</a> and the reason probably is
that the material for studying it inductively has not as yet
been collected and sifted. Strange to say, it does not
appear in the index to Dr. Westermarck's great work,
which I have so often quoted: it is hardly to be found
even in the <i>Golden Bough</i>: nor can I find a thoroughgoing
treatment of it in any other books about the early
history of mankind. And any sort of guesswork under
these circumstances only increases our difficulties. Some
years ago the great German philosophical lawyer, von
Jhering, in an interesting work called the <i>Evolution of the
Aryan</i>, made some most ingenious attempts to explain
the origin of Roman divination. He fancied that the
practice of examining the entrails of a victim, for example,
began in the course of Aryan migration, because when
you encamped in a new region you would catch and kill
some of the native cattle in order to see whether they
were wholesome enough to tempt you to stay.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> Again,
the study of the flight of birds was prompted by the desire
to get information about the mountain passes and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>course of great rivers; and this study grew into an
elaborate art as the leader of the host, the prototype of
the Roman augur, gained experience by constant observation
from elevated ground.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">599</a> Such a theory as this last
might be worth something if it were based upon known
facts; as it is, it is only most ingenious guesswork. This
great legal writer did not know, as we do now, that divination
by both these methods is found all over the world,
and cannot be explained by any supposed needs of
migrating Aryans.</p>

<p>Whatever be the origin of the several forms of divination,
the object of the practice in ancient Italy and Greece
is beyond doubt&mdash;to find out whether the Power with
whom you wish to be in right relation is favourable to
certain human operations, or willing to aid in removing
certain forms of human suffering. According to our
definition, it was a part of religion, whether or no it
belonged originally to magic. It was a practical expression
of that doubt or anxiety to which I believe the
Romans attached the word <i>religio</i>. In the agricultural
period it must have been specially useful and even inevitable,<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">600</a>
because the tiller of the soil is always in need of
knowledge as to the best times and seasons for his
operations, and his out-of-door life gives him constant
opportunity of observing natural phenomena, <i>diosemeia</i>,
signs from heaven, and the utterances and movements
of birds and other animals. It is interesting to reflect
that these last may often be of real service in foretelling
the weather, which is so important to the farmer. As I
write this on a December day I recall the fact that I have
myself within the last week successfully foretold a spell of
cold after observing a great arrival of winter thrushes from
the north. This particular branch of augury is, in fact,
neither so inadequate nor so absurd as most others. Von
Jhering may turn out to be right in his notion that at
least some forms of divination have their origin in practical
needs and in the skill of uncivilised man in discerning the
signs of the weather&mdash;a skill which it is well to remember
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>far exceeds that of the house-dweller of modern civilisation.
But with the growth of the City-state and the
habits of life in a town, these early instincts and methods
of the agriculturist came to be caught up into a system
of religious practice, adapted to the conditions of civil and
political existence; thus they gradually lost their original
meaning and such real value as they ever possessed. I
have pointed out that the Roman festivals and the ritual of
the oldest calendar gradually got out of relation with the
agricultural life in which they for the most part originated:<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">601</a>
so it was with divination, which in the hands of
the State authorities became formalised into a set of rules
for ascertaining the good-will of the gods, and obtaining
their sanction for the operations of the community, which
had no scientific basis whatever, no relation to truth and
fact. Of all the methods for putting yourself in right
relation with the Power, this was the least valuable, and
indeed the most harmful; it came in course of time to be
a positive obstacle to efficiency and freedom of action, it
wasted valuable time, and it often served as the means of
promoting private ends to the detriment of the public
interest.</p>

<p>Before I go on to consider the development of the
highly formalised system of public divination, let me clear
the ground by a few remarks about such forms of the
practice as were not sanctioned by the State. That these
existed throughout Roman history there is no doubt, as
they existed in Greece, among the Jews, and elsewhere in
the East, alongside of the advanced and organised methods
of official and authorised experts.</p>

<p>Our information about private divination is scattered
about in Roman literature, and even when brought together
there is not a great deal of it. What is prominent
both in Roman literature and Roman history is the
divination authorised by the State and systematised by
its authorities; even in Cicero's treatise <i>de Divinatione</i>,
though the subject-matter is of a general kind, drawn
from Greece as well as Rome, it is, I think, apart from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>philosophical questions, chiefly the art of augurs and
haruspices that interests the writer, who was himself an
augur when he wrote it. In Greek literature exactly the
opposite is the case; there we hear little of State-authorised
divination, and a great deal of wandering soothsayers,
soothsaying families, and oracles which (except at
Delphi) were not under the direct control of a City-state.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">602</a>
The methods of divination are much the same in both
peninsulas, and indeed vary little all the world over;
the difference lies simply in this,&mdash;that at Rome the
adoption and systematisation by the State of certain
methods, especially those which dealt with birds and
lightning, had the effect of discrediting, if not excluding,
an immense amount of private practice of this kind. I
mean that if the State strongly sanctions some forms of
divination, working them by its own officials, it casts a
shadow of discredit over the rest. As the <i>ius divinum</i>
tended to exclude magic and the barbarous in ritual, so
did the <i>ius augurale</i>, which was a part of it, exclude the
quack in divination. And in this particular department
of human delusion the result may be said to have been
happy; for though divination belongs to religion as
having survived from an earlier stage into a religious
one, yet it is the least valuable, the least fruitful, part of
it.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> True, the augural systematisation, as we shall see,
had a sinister effect on political progress; but even there
the very emptiness and absurdity of the whole business
helped to bring contempt on it, and, as Cicero tells us in
a well-known passage, even old Cato declared that he
could not imagine why a <i>haruspex</i> did not laugh when he
met a brother of the craft.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> In Greece, on the contrary,
it might, I believe, be shown that the absence of systematisation
by the State only served to prolong the credit
and influence of the professional quack.</p>

<p>Greece was at all periods full of these quacks; did the
sham prophet exist at Rome in the period we have now
under review? Later on the Oriental soothsayer found
his way there; of these <i>Chaldaei</i> and <i>mathematici</i> I shall
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>have a word to say in another lecture, and we shall see
how the State authorities made occasional attempts to
exclude them. Of the <i>frantic</i> type of diviner, the &#7956;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#959;&#987;,
so common in Greece, we hear nothing in the sober
Roman annals; the idea of a human being "possessed
by a spirit of divination" seems foreign to the Roman
character.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">605</a> The only soothsayer, so far as I know, who
appears in Roman legend in a private capacity is that
Attus Navius who gave Tarquinius Priscus the benefit of
his knowledge; and he is represented as a respectable
Sabine, and his art as an augural one learnt from the
Etruscans.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">606</a> There are, indeed, ancient traces of a prophetic
art at Rome, but, as the historian of divination has
well observed, they are all connected not with human
beings, but with divinities, a fact which explains the
Latin word <i>divinatio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> To take what is perhaps the best
example, the ancient deity Carmenta, who had a flamen
and a double festival in the month of January, may very
probably represent some dim tradition of a <i>numen</i> at
whose shrine women might gain some knowledge as to
their fortunes in childbirth, just as outside Rome, at Praeneste
and Antium, Fortuna seems to have had this gift
in historical times.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">608</a> So St. Augustine interpreted Carmenta,<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">609</a>
probably following Varro; and to Virgil she was
the "<i>vates fatidica</i>, cecinit quae prima futuros Aeneadas
magnos et nobile Pallanteum."</p>

<p>But Carmenta, Picus, Faunus, are dim mythical figures
which for us can have no bearing on Roman religious experience;
it would be more to the point to ask what was
the original meaning and history of the word <i>vates</i>, if the
question were answerable in the absence of an early Roman
literature. All we can say about this is that this word had,
as a rule, a certain dignity about it, which enabled it eventually
to stand for a poet, and that it rarely has a sinister
sense, unless accompanied by some adjective specially used
in order to give it.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">610</a> The real word for a quack is <i>hariolus</i>,
and the fact that it is comparatively rare suggests that
the character it expresses was not a common one. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>occurs here and there in fragments of old plays, where,
unluckily, we cannot be quite sure whether it represents a
Greek or a Latin idea. The following lines from the
Telamo of Ennius shows us the <i>hariolus</i>, as well as the
word <i>vates</i> with a discreditable adjective attached:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">sed superstitiosi vates impudentesque harioli</span>
<span class="i0">aut inertes, aut insani, aut quibus egestas imperat,</span>
<span class="i0">qui sibi semitam non sapiunt, alteri monstrant viam,</span>
<span class="i0">quibu' divitias pollicentur, ab iis drachmam ipsi petunt.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">611</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>A more satisfactory bit of evidence as to the existence of
the quack in the second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, when Greece and
the East were beginning to pour their unauthorised
religionists into Italy, is the interesting passage in old
Cato's book on agriculture, in which he urges that the
bailiff of an estate should not be permitted to consult
either a <i>haruspex</i>, <i>augur</i>, <i>hariolus</i>, or <i>Chaldaeus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">612</a> But
on the whole, such little evidence as we possess seems to
confirm the view I hazarded just now, that the overwhelming
prestige of State authority at Rome discouraged
and discredited the quack diviner both in public and
private life. His work in private life was largely that of
fortune-telling, of foretelling the future in one sense or
another; and this was exactly what the State authorities
never did and never countenanced, at any rate until the
stress of the Hannibalic war, and then only in a very
limited sense. Their object was a strictly religious one,
to get the sanction of the divine members of the community
for the undertakings of the human ones. Even
the so-called Sibylline oracles, as we saw, were not
prophecies; and the augural art never provided an answer
to the question, "What is going to happen?" but only to
that much more religious one, "Are the deities willing
that we should do this or that?"<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">613</a></p>

<p>But before I leave the subject of private divination, I
must note that there was a department of it which may
be called legitimate, as distinguished from that of the
quack. I mean the <i>auspicia</i> of the family religion, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>also the comparatively harmless folklore about omens of
all sorts and kinds.</p>

<p>Naturally we have little information about legitimate
<i>auspicia</i> in the life of the family; but we have seen that
the religious instinct of the Roman forbade him to face
any important undertaking or crisis without making sure
of the sanction of the <i>numina</i> concerned, and among the
methods of insurance (if I may use a convenient word)
the <i>auspicia</i> must have had a place from the earliest times.
No important thing was done, says Cicero in the <i>de Divinatione</i>,
"nisi auspicato, ne privatim quidem."<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">614</a> Valerius Maximus
says the same in so many words, and some other
evidence has been collected by De Marchi in his work on
the private religion of the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">615</a> But only in the
case of marriage do we hear of <i>auspicia</i> in historical
times, and even there they seem to have degenerated into a
mere form. "Auspices nuptiarum, re omissa, nomen tantum
tenent"&mdash;so Cicero wrote of his own time;<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">616</a> he seems to
be thinking of augury by means of birds, for he adds,
"nam ut nunc extis sic tunc avibus magnae res impetrari
solebant." As we have already seen, the object of the
examination of a victim's entrails was simply to ascertain
its fitness to be offered; but by Cicero's time the Etruscan
art of divination by this method must have penetrated
into private life. I think we may conjecture that in the
life of the family on the land the <i>auspicia</i>, as the word
itself implies, were worked chiefly by observation of birds.
Nigidius Figulus, the learned mystic of Cicero's time,
wrote a book, <i>de Augurio Privato</i>, of which one fragment
survives which has to do with this kind of divination, and
with the distinction between omens from birds seen on
the right or left, and from high or low flyers.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> In the
familiar ode of Horace beginning, "Impios parrae recinentis
omen,"<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">618</a> the <i>corvus</i> and <i>cornix</i> are mentioned besides the
<i>parra</i>, and in that wholesome old out-of-door life of the
farm, as I said just now, there was a certain basis of truth
and fact in the observation of such presages. But Horace
mentions other animals, wolf, fox, and snake, and some at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>least of the folklore about omens which is to be found in
Pliny's descriptions of animals may help us to appreciate
the nature of the old Roman ideas on this subject. The
tiller of the land and the shepherd on the uplands used
their eyes and ears, not wholly without advantage to
themselves; but in the life of the city such observation
became gradually formal and meaningless, and degenerated
into the superstition reflected in Horace's ode. I must
parenthetically confess to a personal feeling of regret that
this people, who in their early days had good opportunities,
made little or no contribution to the knowledge of animals
and their habits.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> But I must pass on to the more important
subject of divination as developed and formalised
by the authorities of the State.</p>

<p>In explaining the ritual of the <i>ius divinum</i> I laid stress
on the fact that its main object was to maintain the <i>pax
deorum</i>, the right relation between the divine and human
citizens.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> To make this <i>pax</i> secure, it was necessary
that in every public act the good-will of the gods should
be ascertained by obtaining favourable auspices&mdash;it must
be done <i>auspicato</i>. To take the first illustration that
occurs, Livy describes a dictator about to fight a battle as
leaving his camp <i>auspicato</i>, after sacrificing to obtain the
<i>pax deorum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">621</a> It is for this reason that the <i>auspicia</i> have
a leading place in the foundation legends of the city. We
are all familiar with the story of the <i>auspicia</i> of Romulus
and Remus, which goes back at least as far as Ennius;<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">622</a>
and we find them also in the foundation of <i>coloniae</i> in
historical times.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> I do not know that I can better
express the place which the <i>auspicia</i> occupied in the
mind of the Roman than by quoting the words which
Livy puts into the mouth of Appius Claudius in 367 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
when supposed to be inveighing against the opening of the
consulship to plebeians: "Auspiciis hanc urbem conditam
esse, auspiciis bello ac pace, domi militiaeque, omnia geri,
quis est qui ignoret?" He goes on to argue that these
<i>auspicia</i> belong to patricians only, that no plebeian magistrate
is created <i>auspicato</i>, that the man who wants to allow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>plebeians to become curule magistrates, <i>tollit ex civitate
auspicia</i>. "Nunc nos, tanquam iam nihil pace deorum
opus sit, omnes caerimonias polluimus."<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> This is, of
course, only Livy's rhetoric, but it represents the fundamental
Roman idea of the public <i>auspicia</i>.</p>

<p>The passage is also useful because it alludes to the fact
that the right of taking the <i>auspicia</i> belonged ultimately
to the whole patrician body of fully qualified citizens.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">625</a>
But so far as we can discern in the dim light of the
earliest period, this body entrusted the right and duty to
its chief magistrate, the Rex, exactly as it entrusted him
with the <i>imperium</i>, the supreme power of command in
civil matters. Thus the <i>auspicia</i> and the <i>imperium</i> were
indissolubly connected; as Dr. Greenidge says,<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">626</a> "they
are the divine and human side of the same power," and
may be found together in a thousand passages in Roman
literature and inscriptions. But at the side of the Rex
we find, according to tradition, two helpers or advisers
called <i>augures</i>, the three together perhaps forming a
<i>collegium</i>.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">627</a> Now there was certainly an important
difference between the Rex and the augurs; the latter
were aiders and interpreters, but the Rex only was said
<i>habere auspicia</i>, just as the whole patrician body had this
right, though they delegated it to the Rex during his
lifetime, and on his death received it again. The man
who "habet auspicia" has the right of <i>spectio</i>, <i>i.e.</i> of taking
the auspices in a particular case,<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> of watching the sky or
the conduct of the sacred fowls in eating; this right the
augurs never had. Their power was limited to guidance
and interpretation. This follows necessarily from the
fundamental principle that the <i>auspicia</i> and the <i>imperium</i>
were indissolubly connected; for the augur, of course,
never possessed the <i>imperium</i> by virtue of his office. It
is true that of the augur in the regal period we know
almost nothing; his art, as we shall see directly, was kept
strictly secret, and he was bound by oath not to reveal it.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">629</a>
But we may safely argue back in general terms from the
relation of magistrate and augur under the later Republic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>to the relation of augur and Rex, from whom descended
the magistrate's <i>imperium</i>. The one essential thing to
remember is that <i>it was in all periods the magistrate who
was responsible</i>, under the sanction and advice of his
assistants the pontifices and augurs, for the maintenance
of the <i>pax deorum</i>. The lay element in the actual working
of the constitution never lost this prerogative. Rome was
never hierarchically governed.</p>

<p>It would be going beyond the scope of these lectures
if I were to plunge at this point into the thorny question
of the exact relation between magistrate and augur in
respect of details. Nor do I propose to go into the
minutiae of augural lore, which are not instructive, like
those of sacrifice, for our survey of Roman religious
experience. It will be sufficient to state in outline what
I believe to be necessary for our purpose.<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">630</a> The person
who had the <i>auspicia</i>, <i>i.e.</i> originally the Rex, like the later
magistrate, had to watch for signs from heaven; in order
to do so he marked out a <i>templum</i>, a rectangular space,
by noting certain objects, trees or what not, beyond
which, whether he looked at earth or sky, he need take no
notice of what he saw. The spot where he took up his
position for this purpose was itself a rectangular space,<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">631</a>
marked out on a similar principle; in each case the space
was <i>liberatus effatus</i>, <i>i.e.</i> freed from previous associations
by a form of words, and ready, if need were (as in the
case of <i>loca sacra</i>) to be further handed over to the deities
as their property; this consecration, however, did not, of
course, follow in the ordinary procedure of the <i>auspicia</i>.
In the <i>urbana auspicia</i> all <i>loca effata</i> must be within the
sacred boundary of the <i>pomoerium</i>. Within this the
magistrate watched in silence at the dead of night for
such signs as he especially asked for (<i>auspicia impetrativa</i>);
those which offered themselves without such specification
(<i>oblativa</i>) he was not bound to take cognisance of unless
some one claimed his attention for them. The signs were
originally in the regal period, if we may guess from the
word <i>auspicium</i>, only such as birds supplied, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>space in which they were watched for was not complicated
by the divisions of the later augural art.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">632</a> The business
of the augur was, we may suppose, to see that the details
were carried out correctly, and to interpret the signs; but
those signs were not sent to <i>him</i>, for he was not the
actual representative of the State in this ritual.</p>

<p>If the constitutional position and duty of the augurs
have now been made sufficiently clear, I may go on
to explain briefly, as in the case of the pontifices, how
the office became gradually secularised, and the duty
formalised, so that if there ever had been anything of a
really religious character in this art, any genuine belief
in the manifestation by the Power of his will in matters
of State life, such character, such belief, had become by
the second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> entirely paralysed and destroyed.
But the history of the augurate is much more difficult to
follow than that of the pontificate. The work of the
pontifices touched the life of every day, public and
private, at many points, with the result that their secrets
ceased to be secrets by the end of the fourth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
The work of the augurs was occasional, and more technical
than that of the other college; it can hardly be said
to have affected the religion of family life, nor did it continually
bear upon public life, as did the pontifical knowledge
of the <i>ius divinum</i> and the calendar. Hence the
augural lore was never published, under pressure of public
opinion, and neither ancient nor modern scholars have
had to waste their time in investigating it. Books were
indeed written about it in later times by one or two
curious students, but in the time of Cicero, who was
himself an augur, the neglect of it was general, even by
members of the college.<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">633</a></p>

<p>This mysterious augural lore was preserved in books,
like that of the pontifices; and in all probability these
books were put together in the same period as the latter,
viz., the two centuries immediately following the abolition
of the kingship.<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">634</a> I think there is a strong probability
that the augurate emerged from the age of Etruscan rule
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>which marks the latter part of the kingly period, with
increased importance and fresh activity, the result of
immediate contact with Etruscan methods of divination.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">635</a>
It is likely that they began in this way to cultivate the
art of divination by lightning, which was peculiarly
Etruscan, and to divide their <i>templum</i> into <i>regiones</i>,
which, as I said just now, were not apparently needed
for the observation of omens from birds. How far they
carried this art we cannot tell, owing to the loss of their
books and the commentaries upon them; but about the
Etruscan discipline we do know something. Those who
wish to have a glimpse of it may consult the first chapter
of the fourth volume of Bouch&eacute;-Leclercq's <i>History of
Divination</i>, as a more intelligible account than any known
to me.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">636</a> But all I need to insist on now is the likelihood
that the augurs began the Republican period with a
power of interpretation which was the more important
because the art was changed; it is now the depository
not only of the old bird lore, but of the new lightning
lore. And as this last became the peculiar characteristic
of the art of public divination, and as the augurs were,
like the pontifices, a close self-electing corporation until
104 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> and a close self-electing <i>patrician</i> body until the
lex Ogulnia of 300 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, holding secret meetings every
month on the <i>arx</i>,<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">637</a> and recording their lore in books
which were never made public, they might well have
grown into a powerful hierarchy, <i>if they had only been
possessed of the right of spectio</i>. What saved Rome from
this fate was simply the fact that the college was a body
of interpreters only, or, in other words, the principle that
the <i>auspicia</i> belonged exclusively to the magistrate. The
<i>auspicia</i> were in fact a matter of public law, not of
religion, properly speaking; the idea on which they were
based, that the sanction of the deities was needed for
every public action, very early lost its true significance,
and the process of taking them became a mere form, the
religious character of which was almost entirely forgotten.
They ceased to be matter of religion just as the amulet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>or any other form of preventive magic fails to be
reckoned as within the sphere of religion; the feeling
was there that they must be attended to (though even
that feeling lost its strength in course of time), but only
as a matter of custom, not because the Power was really
believed to sanction an act in this way.</p>

<p>Thus it seems that the importance of the augurs
belongs to Roman public law, and not to the history of
Roman religious experience. It will be found fully
explained, in that connection, in Mommsen's <i>Staatsrecht</i>,
or in Dr. Greenidge's volume on <i>Roman Public Life</i>.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">638</a>
All we have to note here is the complete secularisation
of what was once really a part of the Roman religion;
the augurs themselves were public men and could hold
magistracies, and their art of interpretation came to be
used for secular and political purposes only. They
could declare a magistrate <i>vitio creatus</i>, whether they
had been present at the taking of the auspices or not;
they could also on appeal stop the proceedings at a
public assembly, whether for election or legislation; it
may be said of them that in one way or another they
had a veto on every public transaction.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">639</a> As Cicero
expresses it in his <i>ius divinum</i>, in the second book of his
work on the constitution: "Quae augur iniusta nefasta
vitiosa dira defixerit inrita infectaque sunto, quique non
paruerit, capital esto."<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">640</a> But in spite of the fine words
<i>iniusta nefasta vitiosa</i>, there was no religious principle
involved in this solemn injunction. When Bibulus in 59
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> sought as consul to stop Caesar's proceedings by
using his right of <i>spectio</i>, all he had to do was to announce
that he was going to look for lightning (<i>obnuntiare</i>);
and if there had been the smallest remnant of religious
belief left in the Roman mind about such transactions,
it would quietly have acquiesced, in the conviction that
Jupiter would send lightning to the Roman magistrate
who asked for it; as it was, Caesar took no notice, and
the Roman people only laughed. Caesar was at the
time, let us note, the head of the Roman religion, pontifex
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>maximus. So with the augurs as the interpreters of
the magisterial <i>spectio</i>; proud as Cicero was of becoming
an augur, with all the old surviving elective ritual,<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">641</a> he
never, we may be sure, believed for a moment that he
had the power of interpreting the will of the gods. A
century before his augurship the whole business of public
divination had been regulated by statute, like any other
secular matter; and in his own day it was an open
question with men of education whether there were such
a thing as divination at all.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">642</a> True, as we shall see, the
<i>illegitimate</i> forms of divination were at this very time
gaining ground, as the current of superstition increased
in strength which marks this last period of the
republic; but the augur's art and the <i>spectio</i> of the
magistrate were still surviving as mere constitutional
fossils, and were not destined to share largely in Augustus'
heroic attempt to put fresh life into the <i>ius divinum</i>.
<i>Vile damnum</i>, as Tacitus said of the foreign quacks
banished to Sardinia by Tiberius; for neither in the
sphere of religion nor later in that of politics can the art
of divination be said to have had any lasting value.</p>

<p>I have not dealt at any length with the augurs and
the State system of divination, but I hope I have said
enough to show that, as I hinted at the beginning of this
lecture, it affords an excellent illustration of the way in
which the religious instinct, the desire to be in right
relation with the Power manifesting itself in the universe,
was first soothed and satisfied, then hypnotised and
paralysed, by the formalisation and gradual secularisation
of religious processes. The desire to obtain the sanction
of the Power by seeking for favourable signs or omens
seems to be a universal instinct of human nature, though
a perverse one; if left to itself it will apparently pass
into the region of harmless folklore, where it does not
seriously interfere with human progress, either secular or
religious; but where, as at Rome, it is taken up into the
ritual of a religious system, and is further allowed to
express itself mechanically in the region of public law,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>it exhausts itself rapidly, loses all its original significance,
and becomes a clog on human progress.</p>

<p>In ancient Italy this instinct for divination was nowhere
so strongly and so perversely developed into a mechanical
system as in Etruria, and it is highly probable that this
development contributed largely to the rapid political and
moral decay of the Etruscan people. The narrow aristocratic
constitution of the Etruscan cities, worked by a
kind of priestly nobility, seems to have afforded great
opportunities for the cultivation of the perverse art which
(as we are now beginning to recognise) this people had
brought with them from the East.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">643</a> I have already suggested
that an Etruscan dominion at Rome had very probably
unfortunate results in developing and formalising the
art of the augurs. But the age of the Tarquinii was not
the only one in which the sinister influence of this strange
people was brought to bear on Roman religious institutions;
and before I close this lecture I must say a very
few words about a second invasion of Etruscan perversity,
which began some two centuries and a half later. This
was the result of that renewed <i>religio</i>, that feeling of
anxiety and sometimes of despair characteristic of the
last half of the third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, the perilous era of the
Punic wars, with which I shall deal more particularly in
the next lecture. The state religion could not soothe it;
neither pontifices nor augurs had any sufficient native
remedy for it, and as the ritual of worship was reinforced
from Greece and the East, so the ritual of divination was
reinforced from Etruria.</p>

<p>The Etruscans seem to have educated their diviners
with care and system. We do not know the details of
such education, but it seems likely that there were schools
of these prophets, by means of which the art was handed
down and developed.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">644</a> The word for the person thus
trained was <i>haruspex</i> in its Italian form as known to us,
though it had an Etruscan original.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">645</a> The art acquired
was of three kinds&mdash;the interpretation of lightning; the
explanation and interpretation of the entrails of victims,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>and especially of the liver; and, thirdly, the explanation
and expiation of portents and prodigia.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> All three
departments seem to have been carried to an extreme
degree of perverse development. To give an idea of it I
need but refer to recent discussions of the relation between
the divisions marked on a bronze model of a victim's
liver (found in 1877 at Piacenza), in which are written
the Etruscan names of a great number of deities, and the
somewhat similar divisions of the templum of the heavens
as given by Martianus Capella in explanation of the
celestial dwellings of the Italian deities. A study of this
unprofitable subject, of which the only interest lies in the
illustration it offers of the prostitution of human ingenuity,
will be found in a little work by Carl Thulin, published
in the series called <i>Religionsgeschichtliche Versuche und
Vorarbeiten</i>.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">647</a></p>

<p>Just as the Roman authorities had recourse from time
to time to the Sibylline books, so also they occasionally,
though not apparently before the Punic wars, sought the
help of the trained Etruscan diviners. We shall come
across instances of this in the next two lectures, and I
need not specify them now. They seem to have used
their art in all its departments; and in the most degraded
of these, the examination of entrails, it was found so convenient
to have their services in a campaign that in course
of time one at least seems to have accompanied every
Roman army.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">648</a> The complicated art of augury might in
fact be dispensed with if you had a <i>haruspex</i> ready and
willing at a moment's notice to give you a good report
of the victim's liver. To keep up the supply of experts,
the senate, probably in the second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, determined
to select and train ten boys of noble family in
each Etruscan city. This was the last service that the
degenerate Etruscan people rendered to its conquerors,
and a more degrading one it is impossible to imagine.
These foreign diviners were never admitted to the dignity
of a <i>collegium</i>;<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">649</a> they rather played the part of the
domestic chaplain kept to say grace before meat. For
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>a moment they attract our attention in connection with
the persecution of Cicero by his political enemies, and the
<i>consecratio</i> after his exile of the site of his house on the
Palatine hill.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">650</a> For a moment again we meet with them
in the reign of Claudius, who was interested in the
Etruscans and wrote a work about them, and once raised
the question in the senate of the revival of the haruspices
and their art&mdash;such part of it, at least, as might seem
worth preserving&mdash;"ne vetustissima Italiae disciplina per
desidium exolesceret."<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">651</a> And strange to say, though in
fact no part of this ancient Italian discipline was in the
least worth preserving, it survived in outward form into
the fourth century of the empire.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">652</a> We read with astonishment
in the code of the Christian emperor Theodosius,
that if the imperial palace or other public buildings are
struck by lightning the haruspices are to be consulted,
according to ancient custom, as to the meaning of the
portent.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">653</a> Thirteen years after the death of Theodosius,
in 408, Etruscan experts offered their services to
Pompeianus, prefect of Rome, to save the city from the
Goths. Pompeianus was tempted, but consulted Innocent,
the Bishop of Rome, who "did not see fit to oppose his
own opinion to the wishes of the people at such a crisis,
but stipulated that the magic rites should be performed
secretly." What followed is uncertain. "The Christian
historian says that the rites were performed, but were
unavailing; the pagan Zosimus affirms that the aid of the
Tuscans was declined."<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">654</a> So hard died the futile arts of
the most unfruitful of all Italian races.</p>

taking the auspices "pitched his tent" (<i>tabernaculum</i>), looking to

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_633_633" id="Footnote_633_633"></a><a href="#FNanchor_633_633"><span class="label">633</span></a> Cicero expressly says that even old Cato complained of the
neglect of the auspicia by the college: <i>de Div.</i> i. 15. 28; above, in
sec. 25, he had said the same thing of the augurs of his own day,
<i>i.e.</i> including himself. We know of a work on the <i>auspicia</i> by M.
Messalla, an augur, from which Gellius, xiii. 15, quotes a lengthy
extract (cp. ch. 14). This man was consul in 53 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>; Schanz,
<i>Gesch. der r&ouml;m. Lit.</i>, ii. 492. Just at the same time Appius Claudius,
Cicero's predecessor as governor of Cilicia, wrote <i>libri augurales</i>, to
which Cicero more than once alludes in his correspondence with
Appius: <i>ad Fam.</i> iii. 9. 3 and 11. 4. It is plain that the old augural
lore is now treated only as a curiosity, of which the secrecy need no
longer be respected.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_634_634" id="Footnote_634_634"></a><a href="#FNanchor_634_634"><span class="label">634</span></a> P. Regell, <i>De augurum publicorum libris</i>, whose excellent
little work has never been superseded, thinks (p. 19) that the <i>libri</i>
were the result of the neglect of the art, <i>i.e.</i> that it was necessary to
put it in writing, because otherwise it would be forgotten. "Tota
eius vita," he says, "lenta est mors." The lore was complete about
the time of the decemvirate, but <i>decreta</i> must have been continually
added (p. 23). The nucleus may be represented in Cicero, <i>de Legibus</i>,
ii. 20. 21, and perhaps existed in Saturnian verse (Festus, 290). The
additions in the way of decree or comment would probably range
over the fourth and third centuries <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> like those of the pontifices.
No doubt the Hannibalic war had the effect of diminishing the
importance of the lore, as the next lecture should show. On the
whole we may put the great period of the college between the
decemvirate and the war with Hannibal.</p></div>

p. 205 foll.; cp. Wissowa, <i>R.K.</i> p. 457. Cicero calls the augurs
"interpretes Iovis Optimi maximi" (<i>de Legibus</i>, ii. 20), and herein could
hardly have made a mistake, as he was himself an augur. As the
great deity was of Etruscan origin in this form, I should conjecture
that the college took new ground and gained new influence under
the Etruscan dynasty.</p></div>

<h4>LECTURE XIV</h4>

<h5>THE HANNIBALIC WAR</h5>


<p>We have noticed two different, if not opposing, tendencies
in Roman religious experience since the disappearance
of the kingship. First, there was a tendency towards
the reception of new and more emotional forms of worship,
under the direction of the Sibylline books and their
keepers; secondly, we have seen how, in the hands of
pontifices and augurs, religious practice became gradually
so highly formularised and secularised that the real
religious instinct is hardly discernible in it, except indeed
in the degraded form of scruple as to the exact performance
of the ritual laid down. There was also, towards
the end of that period, a third tendency beginning to show
itself, which was eventually to complete the paralysis of
the old religion&mdash;a tendency to neglect and despise the
old religious forms. This need not surprise us, if we
keep in mind two facts: (1) that Rome is now continually
in close contact with Greece and her life and thought;
(2) that it seems to be inevitable in western civilisation
that a hard and fast system of religious rule should
eventually arouse rebellion in certain minds. Already
there are a few signs that the regulations of the <i>ius
divinum</i> are not invariably treated with respect.</p>

<p>As long ago as 293 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> and the last struggle with the
Samnites, we find a trace of this neglect or carelessness.
One of the chicken-keepers (<i>pullarii</i>) reported falsely to
the consul Papirius that the sacred chickens had given
good omen in their eating: this was discovered by a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>young nephew of Papirius, "iuvenis ante doctrinam deos
spernentem natus," as Livy calls him, and came to the
consul's ears. Papirius' reception of the news was characteristic
of the way in which a Roman could combine
practical common-sense with the formal respect claimed
by his <i>ius divinum</i>; he declared that the omen had been
reported to him as good, and therefore "populo Romano
exercituique egregium auspicium est." The umpire had
decided favourably for him, and there was an end of the
matter, except indeed that that umpire was placed in the
forefront of the battle that the gods might punish him
themselves, and there of course he died.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">655</a> A generation
later we have a case of far more pronounced contempt in
the familiar story of P. Claudius Pulcher and his colleague
Junius, each of whom lost a Roman fleet after neglecting
the warning of the <i>pullarius</i>: of Claudius it is told that
he had the sacred chickens thrown into the sea.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> Another
well-known story is that of Flaminius, the democrat
consul who, as we shall learn directly, was defeated and
killed at Trasimene after leaving Rome with none of his
religious duties performed.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">657</a> The famous Marcellus of
this second Punic war, though himself an "augur optimus,"
according to Cicero, declined to act upon an <i>auspicium ex
acuminibus</i>&mdash;electric sparks seen at the end of the soldiers'
spears&mdash;and was accustomed to ride in his litter with
blinds drawn, so that he should not see any evil omen.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">658</a>
Assuredly the transition from superstition to reason had
its ludicrous side even in public life.</p>

<p>But it is not the gradual approach of rationalism that
is the subject of this lecture. For years after the death
of Flaminius we have no trace of it: that was no time
for speculating, and it would have been dangerous. The
religious history of the time, as recorded by Livy, shows
on the contrary that <i>religio</i> in the old sense of the word
is once more occupying the Roman mind&mdash;the sense of
awe in the presence of the Unknown, the sense of sin or
of duties omitted, or merely a vague sense of terror that
suggested recourse to the supernatural. No wonder: for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>though Italy had been invaded within the memory of
living man, it was not then invaded by one who had
sworn to his father in infancy to destroy the enemy root
and branch. Instinctively both Romans and loyal Italians
knew that they were face to face with a struggle for life
and death. It is hard for us to realise the terror of the
situation as it must have been in those days of slow communication
and doubtful news. It is to Livy's credit that
he recognised it fully, and all who look on history as
something more than wars and battles must be eternally
grateful to him for searching the records of the pontifices
for evidence of a people's emotion and the means taken
to soothe it. Polybius has nothing to tell us of this but
a few generalisations, drawn from his own experience a
century later.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">659</a> In all essential attributes of a Roman
historian Livy is far the better of the two. I propose to
follow his guidance in trying to gain some knowledge of
the revived <i>religio</i> of the age and the way in which it was
dealt with by the authorities.</p>

<p>It is in the winter of 218-17, when Hannibal was
wintering in north Italy after his victory at the Trebbia,
that Livy first brings the matter before us.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">660</a> He uses the
word I have just now and so often used: men's minds
were <i>moti in religionem</i>, and they reported many <i>prodigia</i>
which were uncritically accepted by the vulgar. He
begins with Rome, and here it is worth noting that these
portents issue from the crowded haunts of the markets,
the <i>forum olitorium</i>, and the <i>forum boarium</i>, both close to
the river and the quays. In the latter place, for example,
an ox was said to have climbed to the third story of a
house, whence it threw itself down, terrified by the panic
of the inhabitants&mdash;a story which incidentally throws
light on the housing of the lower population at the time.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">661</a>
Other wonders were announced from various parts of
Italy,<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">662</a> and the decemviri were directed to have recourse
to the Sibylline books, except for the <i>procuratio</i> of one
miracle, common in a volcanic country, the fall of pebble-rain.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">663</a>
This had a <i>procuratio</i> to itself by settled custom,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>the <i>novendiale sacrum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">664</a> an expiation parallel with that
which, in the religion of the family, followed a birth or a
death. For the rest, the whole city was subjected to
<i>lustratio</i>,<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">665</a> and, in fact, the whole population was busy with
the work. A <i>lectisternium</i> was ordered for Iuventas,<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">666</a> the
deity of the young recruits, a <i>supplicatio</i> for Hercules at one
of his temples, and five special victims were ordered for
<i>Genius</i>&mdash;directions which have been variously interpreted.
I am disposed to think of them as referring to the capacity
of the State to increase its male population in the face of
military peril. That the authorities were looking ahead
is clear from the fact next stated, that one of the praetors
had to undertake a special vow if the State should survive
for ten years. These measures, ordered by the books,
"magna ex parte levaverant religione animos." Unfortunately,
the wayward consul Flaminius spoilt their
endeavours by wilfully neglecting his religious duties at
the Capitol, and also at the Alban mount, where he should
have presided at the Latin festival, and hurrying secretly
to the seat of war, lest his command should be interfered
with by the aristocrats.</p>

<p>Spring came on, and with the immediate prospect
of a crisis the <i>religio</i> broke out afresh.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">667</a> Marvels were
reported from Sicily and Sardinia, as well as Italy and
Rome. We need not trouble ourselves with them, except
so far as to note that one, at least, was pure invention; at
Falerii, where there was an oracle by lots,<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">668</a> one tablet fell
out of the bundle with the words written on it, <i>Mavors
telum suum concutit</i>. The mental explanation of all
this is lost to us;<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">669</a> it would be interesting to know how
the reports really originated and were conveyed to Rome.
That a widely spread <i>religio</i> is really indicated we can
hardly doubt. The steps taken to soothe it, the religious
prescriptions, are of more value to us. The Senate received
the reports, and the consul then introduced the question
of procuration. Besides decreeing, no doubt with the
sanction of the pontifices, certain ordinary measures, the
Senate referred the matter to the decemviri and the Sibylline
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>books. A <i>fulmen</i>, weighing fifty pounds, was awarded
to Jupiter, and gifts of silver to his consorts in the
Capitoline temple. Then follow directions which show
that the <i>religio</i> of women was to be particularly cared for.
Juno Regina of the Aventine was to have a tribute collected
by matrons, and she and the famous Juno Sospita
of Lanuvium were to have special sacrifices; and it is
probable that another Juno Regina, she of Ardea, was the
object of a sacrifice, which the decemviri themselves undertook
in the forum of that city.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">670</a> This prominence of Juno
may be a counterpart, I think, to the special attention
shown to Hercules and Genius in the previous winter.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">671</a>
And it is interesting to notice that the libertinae were
directed to collect money for their own goddess Feronia.<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">672</a></p>

<p>It is evident that Livy, in detailing these directions
from the books of the pontifices,<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">673</a> took them in the chronological
order in which they were to be carried out; for the
day sacred to Juno Regina of the Aventine is September 1,
that of Feronia November 13, and the last instruction he
mentions is in December, when Saturnus was to have a
sacrifice and <i>lectisternium</i> at his own temple in the forum
(prepared by senators), and a <i>convivium publicum</i>. This
meant, we note with interest, the Graecising of this old
Roman cult, which now took the form which is so familiar
to us of public rejoicing by all classes, including slaves.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">674</a>
But long before these dates the terrible disaster of
Trasimene had forced the Senate, at the urgent persuasion
of the dictator Fabius, to have recourse to
the sacred books again.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">675</a> Never before had they been
so frequently consulted; the ordinary <i>piacula</i> of the
pontifices were not thought of; a consul had grievously
broken the <i>pax deorum</i>, and what remedy was
possible no Roman authority could tell. The prescriptions
of the books were many and various; the most
interesting of them is the famous <i>ver sacrum</i>, an old
Italian custom, already referred to, but here prescribed by
a Greek authority. This was submitted to the people in
Comitia, and carried with quaint provisions suited to protect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>them against any unconscious mistake in carrying out
the vow, such as might produce further <i>religio</i>. We will
only notice that though, according to the old tradition, it
was to Mars that the Italian stocks were wont in time of
famine and distress to dedicate the whole agricultural produce
of the year, together with the male children born that
spring,<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">676</a> in this crisis it is to Jupiter that the vow is
made. It is the Roman people only who here make the
vow, and they make it, I doubt not, to that great Jupiter of
the Capitol who for 300 years has been their guardian, and
in whose temple are kept the sacred books that ordered it.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">677</a></p>

<p>But the authorities were determined to make now a
supreme effort to still the alarm, and to restore the people
to cheerfulness. They went on to vow <i>ludi magni</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
extra games beside the usual yearly <i>ludi Romani</i>, at
a cost of 333,333 and one-third asses, three being the
sacred number. Then a <i>supplicatio</i> was decreed, which
was attended not only by the urban population, but by
crowds from the country, and for three days the decemviri
superintended a <i>lectisternium</i> on a grand scale, such as
had never been seen in Rome before, in which twelve
deities in pairs, Roman and Greek indistinguishable from
each other, were seen reclining on cushions. If Wissowa
interprets this rightly,<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">678</a> as I think he does, it marks a
turning-point in the religious history of Rome. The old
distinction between <i>di indigetes</i> and <i>di novensiles</i> now
vanishes for good; the showy Greek ritual is applied alike
to Roman and to Greek deities; the Sibylline books have
conquered the <i>ius divinum</i>, and the decemviri in religious
matters are more trusted physicians than the pontifices.
The old Roman State religion, which we have been so
long examining, may be said henceforward to exist only in
the form of dead bones, which even Augustus will hardly
be able to make live.</p>

<p>So far, however, all had been orderly and dignified.
But after Cannae we begin to divine that the stress of
disaster is telling more severely on the nervous fibre of
the people. Two Vestals were found guilty of adultery&mdash;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>always a suspicious event; in such times a wicked rumour
once spread would have its own way. One killed herself;
the other was buried alive at the Colline gate. A <i>scriba
pontificis</i>, who had seduced one of them, was beaten to
death by the pontifex maximus. Such a violation of the
<i>pax deorum</i> was itself a prodigium, and again the books
were consulted, and an embassy was sent to Delphi with
Fabius Pictor as leader.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">679</a> Greece is looming ever larger
in the eyes of the frightened Roman.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances it is hardly astonishing to
read of a new (or almost new) and horrible rite, in which a
Greek man and woman and a Gallic man and woman
(slaves, no doubt) were buried alive in the <i>forum boarium</i>
in a hole closed by a big stone, which had already, says
Livy, been used for human victims&mdash;"minime Romano
sacro." As in the case of the Vestals, blood-shedding is
avoided, but the death is all the more horrible. What
are we to make of such barbarism? Technically, it must
have been a sacrifice to Tellus and the Manes, like the
<i>devotio</i> of Decius, and like that also, it probably had in it
a substratum of magic.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">680</a> As regards the choice of victims
it baffles us, for if we can understand the selection of a
Gallic pair at a time when the Gauls of North Italy were
taking Hannibal's side, it is not so easy to see why the
Greeks were just now the objects of public animosity.
Diels has suggested that Gelo, son of Hiero of Syracuse,
deserted Rome for Carthage after Cannae,<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">681</a> and wanting a
better explanation we may accept this, and imagine, if we
can, that the cruel death of a pair of Greek slaves need
not be taken as expressing any general feeling of antagonism
or hatred for things Greek. But, after all, the most
astonishing fact in the whole story is this&mdash;that the
abominable practice lasted into the Empire; Pliny, at
least, emphatically states that his own age had seen it, and
heard the solemn form of prayer which the magister of
the quindecemviri used to dictate over the victims.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">682</a> Pliny,
we may note, also speaks of the <i>forum boarium</i> as the
scene of the sacrifice, where also the first gladiatorial games
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>were exhibited.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">683</a> Rome was already accustomed to see
horrors there.</p>

<p>As we have now reached the climax of the religious
panic of these years, I may pause here for a moment to
refer to an interesting matter which I mentioned in my
third lecture. At this very time, if we accept Wissowa's
conjecture, the twenty-seven puppets of straw known as
Argei, which were thrown over the <i>pons sublicius</i> by the
Vestals on the ides of May, were being substituted as
surrogates for the sacrifice by drowning of the same
number of Greeks (Argei); an atrocity which he fancies
actually took place somewhere in the interval between the
first and second Punic wars, under orders found in the
Sibylline books.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">684</a> All scholars know that there were in
the four regions of the old city twenty-seven (or twenty-four)
chapels, <i>sacella</i>, which were also called Argei, and
have caused great trouble to topographers and archaeologists.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">685</a>
To complete his hypothesis, Wissowa conjectures
that these too date from this same age, and
were distributed over the city in order to take away the
miasma caused by some great pestilence or other trouble,
of which, owing to the loss of Livy's second decade, we have
no information. But neither have we a scrap of information
about the building of the chapels, or the drowning of
the twenty-seven Greeks, an atrocity so abominable that
the only way in which we might conceivably account for
its disappearance in the records would be the hypothesis
of a conspiracy of silence, an impossible thing at Rome.
The loss of Livy's second decade cannot of itself be an
explanation; such an event is just what an epitomator
would have seized on, yet there is no trace of it in the
surviving epitomes, nor in any other author who may have
had Livy before him. Varro knew nothing of it, so far as
we can tell; where he refers to the Argei he makes no
mention of such an astonishing origin either of puppets or
chapels. If there had been a record in the books of the
pontifices, it is impossible to imagine that he was not
aware of it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>On the contrary, he quotes no official record, but a
line of Ennius which attributes the origin of the Argei
to Numa:<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">686</a></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">libaque fictores Argeos et tutulatos.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now Ennius was born in 239<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">687</a> <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and was, therefore,
living when the whole astonishing business began. How
does he come to ascribe to Numa institutions which were
to himself exactly as the building of the Forth Bridge
might be to an Edinburgh man of middle age? Why,
too, if these institutions were of such recent date, did the
Romans of the last two centuries <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> invent all sorts of
wild explanations of them, at which Wissowa very properly
scoffs? It is for him to explain why these explanations
were needed. It is inconceivable that in a large city,
with colleges of priests preserving religious traditions
and formulae, all memory of the remarkable origin of
<i>sacella</i> and puppets should have so completely vanished
as to leave room for the growth of such a crop of explanations.
These will be found in my <i>Roman Festivals</i>,
p. 112, and whoever reads them will conclude at once,
I am sure, that the Romans knew nothing at all about
the true history of the Argei. We may still class this
curious ceremony with some of the primitive magical or
quasi-magical rites of the ancient settlement. We are
not entitled to cite it as an example of the growing
savagery of this trying period; and if it be argued that
it is an example rather of humanity, because for the
original victims straw puppets were substituted, the
answer is that even if we were to grant the human
sacrifice, the surrogation of puppets is a most unlikely
thing to have happened.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">688</a> It is a rare practice; Wissowa
himself judiciously rejects it as an explanation of such
objects as <i>oscilla</i> and <i>maniae</i>. You cannot adopt it when
you choose, to explain a difficulty, and then reject it when
you choose. Why, one may ask, was this humane method
not applied also to the two pairs of Gauls and Greeks
just mentioned? But I need not pursue the subject
further; we may be satisfied to reflect that from an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>anthropological point of view the Argei need never have
been anything more than puppets.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">689</a></p>

<p>But to return to the religious history of the war. It
would seem that the extraordinary series of performances
ordered during the depression and despair that followed
Cannae had succeeded for the time in quieting the <i>religio</i>.
Fabius Pictor too had returned from Delphi,<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">690</a> and brought
home in what seems to be hexameter verse instructions as
to the worship of certain deities, with injunctions to the
Romans to send gifts to the Pythian Apollo if prosperity
should return to them, and ending with the significant
words, "lasciviam (disorderly excitement) a vobis prohibete,"
which may be interpreted as "keep quiet, and do not get
into a religious panic." The hexameters were Greek, but
were translated for the benefit of the people; and Fabius
publicly told how he had himself obeyed the voice of the
oracle by sacrificing to the deities it named, and had
worn the wreath, the sign that he was accomplishing
religious work, during the whole of his journey home.
This wreath he now deposited on the altar of Apollo.
This was in 216, and it is remarkable that we hear of no
new outbreak of <i>prodigia</i>, the normal symptom of <i>religio</i>,
till the next year. Then we have a list; as Livy says,<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">691</a>
"simplices et religiosi homines" were ready with them
at any time. A panic arose in Rome, not strictly of
a religious kind, which shows the nervousness of the
population; a rumour went about that an army had
been seen on the Janiculum, but men who were on the
spot refuted it. In this case the Sibylline books were
not consulted, but Etruscan haruspices were called in,
who simply ordered a <i>supplicatio</i> of the new kind, at
the <i>pulvinaria</i>. This is the first, or almost the first
instance of these experts being consulted; earlier statements
of the kind are probably apocryphal, as I pointed
out in the last lecture. It is not clear why the authorities
had recourse to them at this moment; but I am inclined
to think that the old remedies even of the Sibylline books
and their keepers were getting stale, and that while it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>thought undesirable to excite the people by new rites, it
was felt that the familiar ones might gain some new
prestige by being recommended by new experts. The
old prescription, given by a new physician, may gain in
authority. The next year again, 213, brought another
crop of <i>prodigia</i>, but Livy dismisses them with the simple
words, "His procuratis ex decreto pontificum."<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">692</a> It is
reasonable to suppose that a reaction was taking place
in the minds of the senators and pontifices, and that they
were determined to take as little notice as possible of
disturbing symptoms, relying on the prestige of the
Delphic oracle, and acting on its advice to suppress
<i>lascivia</i>.</p>

<p>But in this same year the <i>lascivia</i> broke out again
with unprecedented force. The cause was not only, as
Livy explains it, the dreary continuance of the war
with varying success; if we read between the lines we
may guess that the break-up of family life occasioned
by the deaths of so many heads of houses and their sons,
had opened the way for <i>feminine</i> excitement and for the
introduction of external rites such as an old Roman
<i>paterfamilias</i> would no more have tolerated than the
pontifices themselves. "Tanta religio," says Livy,<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">693</a> "et
ea magna ex parte externa, civitatem incessit, <i>ut aut
homines, aut dii repente alii viderentur facti</i>"; it
seemed as if the old religious system, in spite of all its
highly formalised apparatus of expiation, was being
deliberately set aside. "Nec iam in secreto modo
atque intra parietes abolebantur Romani ritus: sed in
publico etiam ac foro Capitolioque (this is the hardest
cut of all) <i>mulierum</i> turba erat, nec sacrificantium nec
precantium deos patrio more." To understand such an
amazing religious rebellion against the <i>ius divinum</i> we
must remember that 80,000 men had fallen at Cannae,
besides great numbers in the two previous years, and
that therefore the real effective human support of that
<i>ius</i> had in great part given way. Private priests and
prophets, vermin to be found all over the Graeco-Roman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>world, had captured for gain the minds of helpless
women, and of the ruined and despairing population of
the country now flocking into Rome. The aediles and
triumviri capitales, responsible for the order of the city,
could do nothing; the Senate had to commission the
praetor urbanus to rid the people of these <i>religiones</i>.
When in those days the Senate and magistrates took
such a matter in hand, further rebellion was impossible.
All we are told is that the praetor issued an edict
ordering that all who possessed private forms of prophecy
or prayer, or rules of sacrifice, should bring them to
him before the kalends of April next; and that no one
should sacrifice in public with any strange or foreign
rite. I do not know that the wonderful good sense
of this decree has ever been commented on. To take
violent or cruel measures would have been dangerous
in the extreme at such a psychological moment. Livy
tells this story at the very end of the year 213, and
the kalends of April referred to must be those of the
next year; there was, therefore, plenty of time to obey
the order, and in the meantime the excitement might
subside of itself. The mischief was not absolutely and
suddenly stopped; in private houses the new rites
were allowed to go on,&mdash;a policy adhered to in time
to come,&mdash;but the <i>ius divinum</i> of the Roman State,
the public worship of the Roman deities, must not be
tampered with. This wise policy seems to have succeeded
for the time; for even after the capture of
Tarentum by Hannibal, and the prospect of an attack in
that direction from Macedonia, we do not hear of any
renewed outbreak. <i>Prodigia</i> are reported as usual, but
the remedy thought sufficient is only a single day's
<i>supplicatio</i> and a <i>sacrum novendiale</i>. The consuls, however,
in the true Roman spirit, devoted themselves for
several days to religious duties before leaving Rome
for their commands.</p>

<p>This was at the beginning of the year 212. But after
the Latin festival at the end of April we hear of a new
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span><i>religio</i>, and a very curious one.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">694</a> It looks as though
certain Latin oracles, written in Saturnian verse, and attributed
to an apocryphal <i>vates</i> of the suspicious name of
Marcius, had got abroad in the panic of the previous year,
and had been confiscated by the praetor urbanus charged,
as we saw, with the suppression of religious mischief. He
had handed them on to the new praetor urbanus of 212.
One of them prophesied the disaster of Cannae which
had already happened; the other gave directions for
instituting games in honour of Apollo, including one
which placed the religious part of these <i>ludi</i> in the
hands of the decemviri. I strongly suspect that the
whole transaction was a plan on the part of the Senate
and the religious colleges, in order to quiet the minds
of the people by a new religious festival in honour of
a great deity of whose prestige every one had heard,
for he had been long established in Rome; he is now
to take a more worthy place there, to be incorporated
in the <i>ius divinum</i> in a new sense, in gratitude perhaps
for his recent advice given to Fabius Pictor at Delphi.
Possibly also he is to be regarded here as the Greek
deity of healing, though we do not hear of any pestilence
at the time; but four years later it was in
consequence of an epidemic that these <i>ludi</i> were renewed
and made permanent. The main object of the moment
was no doubt to amuse the people and occupy
their minds. The whole population took part in the
games, wearing wreaths as partakers in a sacred rite;
the matrons were not left out; and every one kept his
house door open and feasted before the eyes of his
fellow-citizens.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">695</a></p>

<p>If it be asked why these games in honour of a Greek
god should have been suggested by a Latin oracle, the
answer is, I think, that the latter was used rather as a
pretext for a pre-conceived plan; if it be true that the
Marcian verses had won some prestige among the vulgar,
it was an adroit stroke to invent one that might be used
in this way. This is the only way in which we can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>satisfactorily account for the direction to the decemviri
to undertake the necessary sacrifices. The government
seizes a chance of taking the material of <i>religio</i> out of
the hands of the vulgar and utilising it for its own
purposes. It was clever too to give the alleged Latin
oracles the sanction of the <i>Graecus ritus</i>; "decemviri
Graeco ritu hostiis sacra faciant," says the oracle. The
keepers consulted the sacred books as to the projected
<i>ludi</i>, and henceforward, as it would seem, these Latin
oracles were placed in their keeping to be added to
the Sibylline books in the collection on the Capitol.
The amalgamation of Roman and Greek religion is
complete. If there were any doubt of it after the
<i>lectisternia</i> to the twelve gods which we noticed just now,
all such doubt is removed by the religious events of
this year 212&mdash;that famous year in which Hannibal
came within sight of Rome, and fell away again, never
to return.</p>

<p>The student of Roman religious history, and of all
religious psychology, as he follows carefully the extracts
from the priestly records which Livy has embodied in
his story of the last years of the great struggle, will
find much to interest him. Even little things have
here their significance. He will still find relics of the
scruple about the minutiae of the <i>ius divinum</i> to which
the Romans had become habituated under priestly rule&mdash;<i>religio</i>
in that sense in which it is least really religious.
He will find a Flamen Dialis resigning his priesthood
because he had made a blunder in putting the <i>exta</i> of
a victim on the altar;<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> only too ready, it may have
been, to take an opportunity of getting free of those
numerous taboos which deprived the priest of Jupiter
of all possibility of active life. Such a conjecture finds
support in the curious fact that his successor was a youth
of such bad character that his relations induced the
pontifex maximus to select him for the sacred post, in
hopes that the restrictive discipline he would have to
undergo might improve his morals and make him a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>better citizen.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">697</a> About the later history of this youth
I may have something to say in the next lecture.
Again, we find <i>religio</i> of the scrupulous kind sadly
worrying the stout old warrior Marcellus shortly before
his death<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">698</a>: "Aliae atque aliae obiectae animo religiones
tenebant." One of these <i>religiones</i> was a curious one;
he had vowed a temple of Honos and Virtus&mdash;two
deities together; and the pontifices made difficulties,
insisting that two deities could not inhabit the same
<i>cella</i>, for if it should be struck by lightning, how were
you to tell, in conducting the <i>procuratio</i>, to which of
them to sacrifice? The difficulty was solved by building
two temples. Such quaintnesses of the old type of
religious idea are thus still found, but they are becoming
mere survivals.</p>

<p>The <i>prodigia</i> continue, and occasionally, as a new crisis
in the war was known to be approaching, became exacerbated.
In 208, just before the old consul Marcellus left
the city to meet his death, he and his colleague were
terribly pestered with them, and could not succeed in their
sacrificing (<i>litare</i>). For many days they failed to secure
the <i>pax deorum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> When it was known that Hasdrubal was
on his way from Spain, and that the greatest peril of the
war was approaching, special steps were taken to make
sure of that <i>pax</i>.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">700</a> The pontifices ordered that twenty-seven
maidens&mdash;a number of magical significance both in
Greece and Italy<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">701</a>&mdash;should chant a <i>carmen</i> composed by
the poet Livius Andronicus; and in the elaborate ritual
that followed, as the result of the striking of the temple of
Juno on the Aventine by lightning, the decemviri and
haruspices from Etruria also had a share. The procession
of the maidens, singing and dancing through the city till
they reached the temple of Juno by the Clivus Publicius,
was a new feature in ritual, and must have been a striking
one. Doubtless it was all a part of a deliberate policy to
keep the women of the city in good humour, and in touch
with the religion of the State, instead of going after other
gods, as they had already gone and were again to go with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>amazing and perilous fervour. For Juno Regina of the
Aventine was their special deity; and in this case they
were authorised&mdash;all <i>matronae</i> living within ten miles of
the city&mdash;to contribute in money to a noble gift to the
temple.</p>

<p>Hasdrubal was defeated and killed (207), and the
danger passed away. Then, when the news reached Rome
(if Livy's account may be relied on), there followed such
an outburst of gratitude to the deities as we have never
yet met with, and shall not meet with again in Roman
history.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">702</a> It was not only that the State ordered a
<i>supplicatio</i> of three days thanksgiving; men and women
alike took advantage of it to press in crowds to the
temples, the materfamilias with her children, and in her
finest robes: "cum omni solutae metu, perinde ac si
debellatum foret, deis immortalibus grates agerent." I
would draw attention to the fact that here is no mere
fulfilment of a vow, of a bargain, as some will have it; in
this moment of real religious emotion the first thought is
one of thankfulness that the <i>pax deorum</i> is restored, and
that the Power manifesting itself in the universe, though
in the humble form of these dwellers in Roman temples,
would permit the long-suffering people once more to feel
themselves in right relation to him. As we go on with
our studies in the two centuries that follow, let us bear
this moment in mind; it will remind us that the religious
instinct never entirely dies out in the heart of any people.</p>

<p>I would fain stop at this point, and have done with the
war and its religious troubles; but there is one more
event which cannot be omitted,&mdash;the solemn advent of a
new deity, this time neither Greek nor Italian. After the
Metaurus battle, the dreaded Hannibal yet remained in
Italy, and so long as he was there the Romans could
know no security. So far as religion could help them
every possible means had been used; there seemed no
expedient left. In 205 a pretext for inspecting the
Sibylline books was found in an unusual burst of pebble-rain;
and there, as it was given out, an oracle was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>deciphered, which foretold that Hannibal would have to
leave Italy if the Magna Mater of Pessinus were brought
to Rome.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">703</a> In whose brain this idea originated we do
not know, but it was a brilliant one. The eastern cult
was wholly unknown at Rome, was something entirely
new and strange, a fresh and hopeful prescription for an
exhausted patient. The project was seized on with
avidity, and supported by the influence of Delphi and
of that strange soldier mystic the great Scipio.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">704</a> The
best man in the State was to receive the goddess, and
when, after many months, she came to Italy in the form of
a black stone, it was Scipio who was chosen for the duty.
For Attalus, king of Pergamus, had consented to let her
go from her Phrygian home; and when she arrived at
Ostia, Scipio with all the Roman matrons went thither by
land; alone he boarded the ship, received the goddess
from her priests, and carried her to land, where the noblest
women of the State received her,&mdash;received the black stone,
that is,&mdash;and carried it in their arms in turns, while all
Rome poured out to meet her, and burned incense at their
doors as she passed by. And praying that she might
willingly and propitiously into the city, they carried
her into the temple of Victory on the Palatine on the
4th of April, henceforward to be a festal day, the popular
Megalesia.</p>

<p>This Magna Mater was the first Oriental deity introduced
into Rome, and the last deity introduced by the
Sibylline books. It is probable that no Roman then
knew much about the real nature of her cult and its noisy
orgiastic character and other degrading features; it was
sufficient to have found a new prescription, and once more
to have given the people, and especially the women, a
happy moment of hope and confidence. But the truth
came out soon enough; and though the goddess must
have her own priests, it was ordered by a <i>Senatusconsultum</i>
that no Roman should take part in her service.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">705</a> Though
established in the heart of the city, and ere long to have
her own temple, she was to continue a foreign deity outside
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>the <i>ius divinum</i>. As such she belongs to those
worships with which I am not called upon by the plan of
these lectures to deal.</p>

<p>Hannibal withdrew at last from Italy, and in 202 the
war came to an end. Looking at the divine inhabitants of
the city in that year, we may see in them almost as much
a <i>colluvies nationum</i> as in the human population itself.
Under such circumstances neither the old City-state nor its
religion could any longer continue to exist. The decay
of the one reflects that of the other; the failure to trust
the <i>di indigetes</i>, the constant desire to try new and foreign
manifestations of divine power, were sure signs that the
State was passing into a new phase. In the next two
centuries Rome gained the world and lost her own soul.</p>

religious horrors of the Samnites witnessed by the army, and especially
the words "respersae fando infandoque sanguine arae" (see

Pubertas. Wissowa, <i>R.K.</i> 126, thinks of Hebe in a Latin form; in
his view it must be a Greek deity, being brought in by the decemviri
and the books. But we shall find that these begin now to interfere
with Roman cults, and in such a crisis we need not wonder at it.
Wissowa allows that we do not know where this Hebe can have come
from, nor, I may add, why she should have come. That there was
some special meaning in the combination Juventas, Hercules, Genius
I feel sure, and I conjecture that it may be found in the urgent need
of a supply of <i>iuvenes</i>. Hercules and Genius seem both to represent
the male principle of life (<i>R.F.</i> 142 foll.). Juventas speaks for
herself, but we may remember that the <i>tirones</i> sacrificed to her on
the day of the Liberalia (17th March), and that Liber is almost
certainly another form of Genius (<i>R.F.</i> 55).</p></div>

Wissowa, <i>Gesammelte Abhandlungen</i>, p. 227). Cp. Plut. <i>Marcell.</i> 3.
Livy's words, "iam ante hostiis humanis, minime Romano sacro,

<h4>LECTURE XV</h4>

<h5>AFTER THE HANNIBALIC WAR</h5>


<p>The long and deadly struggle with Hannibal ended in
201 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and no sooner was peace concluded than the
Senate determined on war with Macedon. This decision
is a critical moment in Roman history, for it initiated
not only a long period of advance and the eventual
supremacy of Rome in the Eastern Mediterranean, but
also an age of narrow aristocratic rule which remained
unquestioned till revolution broke out with Tiberius
Gracchus. But we cannot safely deny that it was a just
decision. Hannibal was alive, and his late ally, Philip
of Macedon, now in sinister coalition with Antiochus of
Syria, might be capable of invading exhausted Italy.
To have an enemy once more in the peninsula would
probably be fatal to Rome and Italy, and one more
effort was necessary in order to avert such a calamity;
an effort that must be made at once, while Carthage lay
prostrate.</p>

<p>It is necessary to grasp fully the danger of the
moment if we are to understand the part played by
religion (if I may use the word) in bringing about the
desired result. It was most difficult to persuade a people
worn out by one war that it was essential for their safety
that they should at once face another. Historians naturally
look on the success of the Senate in this task as due
to its own prestige, and to the skilful oratory of the
Consul in the speech to the people which Livy has reproduced
in his own admirable rhetoric. But a closer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>examination of the chapters at the beginning of the
historian's thirty-first book will show that religion too
was used, in accordance with the experience of the late
war, to put pressure on the voters and to inspire their
confidence. As we saw in the last lecture, they had
been constantly cheered and braced by religious expedients,&mdash;their
often-recurring <i>religio</i> had been soothed
and satisfied; now the same means were to be used positively
rather than negatively, to help in urging them to a
definite course of action. Some sixty years later Polybius,
writing of the extreme religiousness of the Romans,
expressed his conviction that religion was invented for
political objects, and only serves as the means of bridling
the fickle and unreasoning Demos; for if it were possible
to have a State consisting of wise men only, no such
institution would be necessary.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">706</a> The philosophic historian
is here thinking mainly of the way in which religion was
turned to account by the Roman authorities in his own
lifetime. We cannot have a better illustration of this
than the events of the year 200 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Already, in the autumn of the previous year, the
ground had been prepared. To the plebeian games in
November there had been added a feast of Jupiter (<i>Iovis
epulum</i>), as had been done more than once during the
late war.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">707</a> Jupiter, in the form of his image in the
Capitoline temple, lay on his couch at the feast of the
outgoing plebeian magistrates, with his face reddened with
minium as at a triumph, and Juno and Minerva sat each
on her <i>sella</i> on either side of him; and to give practical
point to this show, corn from Africa was distributed at
four asses the modius, or at most one quarter of the
normal price. When the new consuls entered on office
on the ides of the following March, further religious steps
were at once taken; the political atmosphere was charged
with religiosity. On the first day of their office the
consuls were directed by the Senate, doubtless with the
sanction of the pontifices, to <i>sacrifice to such deities as they
might select</i>, with a special prayer for the success of the
new war which Senate and people (the latter by a clever
anticipation) are contemplating. Haruspices from Etruria
had been adroitly procured, and no doubt primed, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>reported that the gods had accepted this prayer, and
that the examination of the victims portended extension
of the Roman frontier, victory, and triumph.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">708</a> Yet, in
spite of all this, the people were not yet willing; in
almost all the centuries, when the voting for the war took
place, they rejected the proposal of the Senate. Then
the consul Sulpicius was put up to address them, and
at the end of Livy's version of his speech we find him
clinching his political arguments with religious ones.
"Ite in suffragium, bene iuvantibus dis, et quae Patres
censuerunt, vos iubete. Huius vobis sententiae non consul
modo auctor est, sed etiam di immortales; qui mihi
sacrificanti ... laeta omnia prosperaque portendere."
Thus adjured, the people yielded; and as a reward, and
to stifle any <i>religio</i> that might be troubling them, they
are treated to a <i>supplicatio</i> of three days, including an
"<i>obsecratio circa omnia pulvinaria</i>" for the happy result
of the war; and once more, after the levy was over,&mdash;a
heavy tax on the patience of the people,&mdash;the consul
made vows of <i>ludi</i> and a special gift to Jupiter, in case
the State should be intact and prospering five years from
that day.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">709</a></p>

<p>Exactly the same religious machinery was used a few
years later to gain the consent of the people for a war of
far less obvious necessity,&mdash;that with Antiochus of Syria.
It was at once successful. The haruspices were again
on the spot and gave the same report; and then, <i>solutis
religione animis</i>, the centuries sanctioned the war. The
vow that followed, of which Livy gives a modernised
wording, was for <i>ludi</i> to last ten continuous days, and for
gifts of money at all the <i>pulvinaria</i>, where now, as we
gather from these same chapters, the images of the gods
were displayed on their couches during the greater part
of the year.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">710</a></p>

<p>We may realise in accounts like these how far we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>have left behind us the old Roman religion we discussed
in earlier lectures. That religion did not any longer
supply the material needed; it was not suited to be the
handmaid of a political or military policy; it was a real
religion, not invented for political purposes, to use Polybius'
language, but itself a part of the life of the State,
whether active in war, or law, or politics. In the ceremonies
I have just been describing almost all the features
are foreign,&mdash;the <i>pulvinaria</i>, the haruspices, perhaps even
the <i>Iovis epulum</i>; and we feel that though the <i>religio</i>
in the minds of the people is doubtless a genuine thing,
yet the means taken to soothe it are far from genuine,&mdash;they
are <i>mala medicamenta</i>, quack remedies. Such is the
method by which a shrewd, masterly government compels
the obedience of a <i>populus religiosus</i>. After long
experience of such methods, can we wonder that Polybius
could formulate his famous view of religion, or that a great
and good Roman lawyer, himself pontifex maximus, could
declare that political religion stands quite apart from the
religion of the poets, or that of the philosophers, and must
be acted on, whether true or false?<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">711</a></p>

<p>The reporting of <i>prodigia</i> goes on with astonishing
vigour in this period, and seems to have become endemic.
I only mention it here (for we have had quite enough of
it already) because the question arises whether it is now
used mainly for political purposes, or to annoy a personal
rival or enemy. This does not appear clearly from Livy's
accounts, but in an age of personal and political rivalries,
as this undoubtedly was, it can hardly have been otherwise.
Certain it is that the interests of the State were
grievously interfered with in this way. The consuls at
this time, and until 153 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, did not enter on office until
March 15, and they should have been ready to start for
their military duties as soon as the levies had been completed;
instead of which, they were constantly delayed by
the duty of expiating these marvels. In 199 Flamininus,
whose appointment to the command in Macedonia had
of course annoyed the friends of the man he was superseding,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>was delayed in this way for the greater part of the
year, and yet he is said to have left Italy at an earlier
date than most consuls.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">712</a> Thus the change to January 1
for the beginning of the consular year, which took place
in 153 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, was an unavoidable political necessity. Even
the Sibylline books came to be used for personal and
political purposes. In the year 144 the praetor Marcius
Rex was commissioned to repair the Appian and Aniensian
aqueducts and to construct a new one. The <i>decemviri
sacris faciundis</i>, consulting the books, as it was said, for
other reasons, found an oracle forbidding the water to be
conveyed to the Capitoline hill, and seem on this absurd
ground to have been able to delay the necessary work.
Our information is much mutilated, but the real explanation
seems to be that there was some personal spite
against Marcius, who, however, eventually completed the
work.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">713</a> Nearly a century later a Sibylline oracle, beyond
doubt invented for the purpose, was used to prevent
Pompeius from taking an army to Egypt to restore
Ptolemy Auletes to his throne. But all students of Roman
history in the last two centuries <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> are familiar with
such cases of the prostitution of religion or religious
processes, and I have already said enough about it in the
lecture on divination.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">714</a></p>

<p>I do not, of course, mean to assert that personal and
political motives account for all or the greater number
of <i>prodigia</i> reported. There is plenty of evidence that
the genuine old <i>religio</i> could be stirred up by real marvels,
which the government were bound to expiate in order to
satisfy public feeling. Thus in 193 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> earthquakes were
so frequent that the Senate could not meet, nor could any
public business be done, so busy were the consuls with
the work of expiation. At last the Sibylline books were
consulted and the usual religious remedies applied; but
the spirit of the age is apparent in the edict of the consuls,
prompted by the Senate, that if <i>feriae</i> had been
decreed to take place on a certain day for the expiation
of an earthquake, no fresh earthquake was to be reported
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>on that same day.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">715</a> This delicious edict, unparalleled in
Roman history, caused the grave Livy to declare that the
people must have grown tired, not only of the earthquakes,
but of the <i>feriae</i> appointed to expiate them.</p>

<p>Let us turn to another and more interesting feature of
this age, which is plainly visible in the sphere of religion,
as in other aspects both of private and public life: I mean
the growth of <i>individualism</i>. Men, and indeed women
also, as we shall see, are beginning to feel and to assert
their individual importance, as against the strict rules and
traditions, civil or religious, of the life of the family and
the State. This is a tendency that had long been at
work in Greece, and is especially marked in the teaching
of the two great ethical schools of the post-Alexandrian
period, the Epicureans and Stoics. The influence of
Greece on the Romans was already strong enough to have
sown the seeds of individualism in Italy; but the tendency
was at the same time a natural result of enlarged experience
and expanding intelligence among the upper classes.
The second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> shows us many prominent men
of strong individual character, who assert themselves in
ways to which we have not been accustomed in Roman
history, <i>e.g.</i> Scipio the elder, Flamininus, Cato, Aemilius
Paulus and his son, Scipio Aemilianus; and among lesser
and less honourable men we see the tendency in the
passionate desire for personal distinction in the way of
military commands, triumphs, and the giving of expensive
games. This is the age in which we first hear of statues
and portrait busts of eminent men; and magistrates
begin to put their names or types connected with their
families on the coins which they issue.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">716</a></p>

<p>In religion this tendency is seen mainly in the attempts
of the individual, often successful, to shake himself free
of the restrictions of the old <i>ius divinum</i>. I pointed out
long ago that it was a weak point in the old Roman
religion that it did little or nothing to encourage and
develop the individual religious instinct; it was formalised
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>>as a religion of family and State, and made no appeal, as
did that of the Jews, to the individual's sense of right
and wrong.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">717</a> The sense of sin was only present to the
Roman individual mind in the form of scruple about
omissions or mistakes in the performance of religious
duties. Thus religion lost her chance at Rome as an
agent in the development of the better side of human
nature. As an illustration of what I mean I may recall
what I said in an early lecture, that the spirit of a dead
Roman was not thought of as definitely individualised;
it joined the whole mass of the Manes in some dimly
conceived abode beneath the earth; there is no singular
of the word Manes. It is only in the third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
that we first meet with memorial tombstones to individuals,
like those of the Scipios, and not till the end
of the Republican period that we find the words Di Manes
representing in any sense the spirit of the individual
departed.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">718</a></p>

<p>In practical life the quarrel of the individual with the
<i>ius divinum</i> takes the form of protest against the restrictions
placed on the old sacrificing priesthoods, these of
the Flamines and the Rex sacrorum, who, unlike the
pontifices and augurs, were disqualified from holding a
secular magistracy.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">719</a> These priesthoods must be filled
up, and when a vacancy occurred, the pontifex maximus,
who retained the power of the Rex in this sphere, as a
kind of <i>paterfamilias</i> of the whole State, selected the
persons, and could compel them to serve even if they were
unwilling. But the interests of public life are now far
more attractive than the duties of the cults,&mdash;the individual
wishes to assert himself where his self-assertion
will be noted and appreciated.</p>

<p>These attempts at emancipation from the <i>ius divinum</i>
were not at first successful. In 242 a flamen of Mars
was elected consul; he hoped to be in joint command
with his colleague Lutatius of the naval campaign against
Carthage. But the <i>ius divinum</i> forbade him to leave Italy,
and the pontifex maximus inexorably enforced it.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">720</a> Of
this quarrel we have no details; but in 190 a similar case
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>is recorded in full. A flamen Quirinalis, elected praetor,
who had Sardinia assigned him as his province, was stopped
by the <i>ius divinum</i> administered by another inexorable
pontifex maximus; and it was only after a long struggle,
in which Senate, tribunes, and people all took part, that he
was forced to submit. So great was his wrath that he was
with difficulty persuaded not to resign his praetorship.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">721</a>
Naturally it became difficult to fill these priesthoods, for
it was invidious to compel young men of any promise to
commit what was practically political suicide. The office
of <i>rex sacrorum</i> was vacant for two years between 210 and
208;<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">722</a> and in 180 Cornelius Dolabella, a <i>duumvir navalis</i>,
on being selected for this priesthood, absolutely refused to
obey the pontifex maximus when ordered to resign his
secular command. He was fined for disobedience, and
appealed to the people; at the moment when it became
obvious that the appeal would fail, he contrived to escape
by getting up an unlucky omen. <i>Religio inde fuit pontificibus
inaugurandi Dolabellae</i>; and here we have the
strange spectacle of the <i>ius divinum</i> being used to defeat
its own ends. Such a state of things needs no comment.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">723</a></p>

<p>But the most extraordinary story of this kind is that
of a flamen of Jupiter,&mdash;a story which many years ago I
told in detail in the <i>Classical Review</i>. Here I may just
be allowed to reproduce it in outline. In the year 209 a
young C. Valerius Flaccus, the black sheep of a great
family, was inaugurated against his will as Flamen Dialis
by the pontifex maximus P. Licinius.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">724</a> It was within
the power of the head of the Roman religion to use such
compulsion, but it must have been difficult and unusual to
do so without the consent of the victim's relations. In
this case, as Livy expressly tells us, it was used because
the lad was of bad character,&mdash;<i>ob adolescentiam negligentem
luxuriosamque</i>; and it is pretty plain that the step was
suggested by his elder brother and other relations, in order
to keep him out of mischief. For, as we have seen, the
taboos on this ancient priesthood were numerous and strict,
and among the restrictions laid on its holder was one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>which forbade him to leave his house for a single night.
Thus we learn not only that this priesthood was not much
accounted of in those days, but also that for the <i>cura</i> and
<i>caerimonia</i> of religion a pure mind was no longer needed.
But it might be utilised as a kind of penal settlement for
a libertine noble; and it is not impossible that a century
and a quarter later the attempt to put the boy Julius
Caesar into the same priesthood, though otherwise represented
by the historians, may have had the same object.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">725</a>
But the strange thing in the case of Flaccus is that this
very <i>cura</i> and <i>caerimonia</i>, if Livy's account is to be trusted,
had such a wholesome disciplinary effect, that the libertine
became a model youth, the admiration of his own and
other families. Relying on his excellent character he even
asserted the ancient right of this flamen to take his seat
in the Senate, a right which had long been in abeyance <i>ob
indignitatem flaminum priorum</i>; and he eventually gained
his point, in spite of obstinate opposition on the part of
a praetor. Some years later, in 200, this same man
was elected curule aedile.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">726</a> This was clearly the first
example of an attempt to combine the priesthood with a
magistracy, for a difficulty at once arose and was solved
in a way for which no precedent is quoted. Among the
taboos on this priest there was one forbidding him to
take an oath; yet the law demanded that a magistrate
must take the usual oath within five days of entering on
office.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">727</a>] Flaccus insisted on asserting his individuality in
spite of the <i>ius divinum</i>, and the Senate and people both
backed him up. The Senate decreed that if he could
find some one to take the oath for him, the consuls might,
if they chose, approach the tribune with a view to getting
a relieving <i>plebiscitum</i>; this was duly obtained, and he
took the oath by proxy. In his year of office as aedile
we find him giving expensive <i>ludi Romani</i>; and in 184
he only missed the praetorship by an unlucky accident.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">728</a>
In this story we find the self-assertion of an individual
supported by Senate, consuls, and people in breaking
loose from the antiquated restrictions of a bygone age, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>we cannot but sympathise with it. But Roman history
is full of surprises, and among these I know none more
amazing than the successful attempt of Augustus two
centuries later to revive this priesthood with all its
absurdities.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">729</a></p>

<p>The self-assertion of members of the great families
against the <i>ius divinum</i> was inevitable, and in the instances
just noticed the attitude of compromise taken up
by the government was only what was to be expected in
an age of stress and change and new ideas. But in less
than twenty years after the peace with Carthage this
government found itself suddenly face to face with what
may be called a religious rebellion chiefly among the
lower orders, including women; and the authorities unhesitatingly
reverted to the position of conscientious
guardians of the religious system of the City-state. They
began to realise that they had been holding a wolf by the
ears ever since the beginning of the Hannibalic war; that
they had a population to deal with which was no longer
pure Roman or even pure Italian, and that even the
genuine Romans themselves were liable to be moved by
new currents of religious feeling. During the war they
had done all that was possible to meet the mental as well
as the material troubles of this population, even to the
length of introducing the worship, under certain restrictions,
of the great Phrygian Mother of the gods. But now,
in 186, the sudden outbreak of Dionysiac orgies in Italy
showed them that all their remedies were stale and insufficient,
and that the wolf was getting loose in their
hands.</p>

<p>Dionysus had long been housed at Rome, under the
name of Liber, in that temple of Ceres, Liber, and Libera
which was discussed in detail in my eleventh lecture.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">730</a>
But it is not likely that many Romans recognised the
identity of Liber and Dionysus, and it is quite certain that
the characteristic features of the Dionysiac ritual were entirely
unknown at Rome for three centuries after the foundation
of the temple. That ritual, as it existed in Greece
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>from the earliest times, retaining the essential features
which it bore in its original Thracian home,<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">731</a> has lately
been thoroughly examined and clearly expounded by Dr.
Farnell in the fifth volume of his <i>Cults of the Greek States</i>,
and the student of the Roman religious history of this
period would do well to study carefully his fifth chapter.
In most Greek states, as at Athens, in spite of occasional
outbreaks, the wilder aspects of the cult had not been
encouraged, but at Delphi and at Thebes, <i>i.e.</i> on Parnassus
and Cithaeron, the more striking phenomena of
the genuine ritual are found down to a late period. Dr.
Farnell has summed these up under three heads at the
beginning of his account: "The wild and ecstatic
enthusiasm that it inspired, the self-abandonment and
communion with the deity achieved through orgiastic rites
and a savage sacramental act, and the prominence of
women in the ritual, which in accordance with a certain
psychic law made a special appeal to their temperament."<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">732</a>
It meant in fact exactly that form of religious ecstasy
which was peculiarly abhorrent to the minds of the old
Romans, who had built up the <i>ius divinum</i> with its sober
ritual and its practical ideas of the supernatural powers
around them. We found nothing in our studies of this
religion to lead us to suppose for an instant that it had
any mental effect such as "the transcending of the limits
of the ordinary consciousness and the feeling of communion
with the divine nature."<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">733</a> The Latin language
indeed had no native words for the expression of such
emotions.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">734</a></p>

<p>But it would be a great mistake to suppose that there
was no soil in Italy, or even at Rome, where such
emotional rites might take root. We may believe that the
dignity and sobriety of the Roman character was in part
at least the result of the discipline of ordered religion in
family and state; but this is not to say that the Romans
were never capable of religious indiscipline,&mdash;far from it.
The Italian rural festival, then as now, was lively and
indecorous, so far as we can guess from the few glimpses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>we get of it; and at Rome the ancient festival of Anna
Perenna, in which women took part, was a scene of revelry
as Ovid describes it,<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">735</a>&mdash;of dancing, singing, and intoxication,
and we need not wonder that it found no place in
the ancient calendar of the <i>ius divinum</i>. And we have
lately had occasion to notice, in the new ritual instituted
under the direction of the Sibylline books, and more
especially during the great war, clear indications that the
natural emotions of women, even of Roman women, had
to be satisfied by shows and processions in which they
could share, and that the ideal dignity of the Roman
matron had often given way under the terrible stress of
public and domestic anxiety and peril. No wonder then
that when Roman armies had been for years in Greece,
and Greeks were flocking into Rome in larger numbers
every year, the Dionysiac rites should find their way into
Italy, and no wonder too that they should instantly find
a congenial soil, exotics though they were.</p>

<p>The story of the Bacchanalia is told by Livy in his
best manner, and whether or no it be literally true in
every particular, is full of life and interest. It is the
fashion now to reject as false whatever is surprising; and
the latest historian of Rome dismisses Livy's account of
the discovery of the mischief as "an interesting romance."<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">736</a>
Fortunately we are not now concerned with this romance,
if such it be; I only propose to dwell on one or two
points more nearly concerned with our subject.</p>

<p>First, let us note that the seeds of this evil crop
were sown in Etruria, the most dangerous neighbour of
the Romans from a religious point of view; for it is
hardly too much to say that all Greek influences that
filtered through Etruria on their way to Rome were contaminated
in the process. According to the story,<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">737</a> a
common Greek religious quack (<i>sacrificulus et vates</i>, as
Livy calls him), of the type held up to scorn by Plato in
the <i>Republic</i>,<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">738</a> came to Etruria and began to initiate in
the rites; drunkenness was the result, and with drinking
came crime and immorality of all kinds. From Etruria
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>the mischief spread to Rome, and was there discovered
accidentally. According to the evidence given, it began
with a small association of women, who met openly in the
daytime only three times a year. Then it fell under the
direction of a priestess from Campania,&mdash;Rome's other
most dangerous neighbour in regard to religion and
morals,&mdash;who gave it a sinister turn. The meetings were
held at night, and were accompanied not only by the
characteristic features of the old Thracian ritual, but, as
in Etruria, by the most abominable wickedness. It was
said to have infected a large part of the population,
including young members of noble families; for with the
true missionary instinct, young people only were admitted
by the hierophants. We need not necessarily believe all
this; but it is certain, from the steps taken by the government,
about which there is no doubt, that it is in the
main a true account. The storm and stress of the long
war with Hannibal would be enough to account for the
phenomena, even if they were not in keeping with well-known
psychical facts.</p>

<p>Let us now turn for a moment to the attitude of
the government in this extraordinary episode of Roman
religious experience. The danger is dealt with entirely
by the Senate and the magistrates; the authorities of the
<i>ius divinum</i> as such have nothing to do with it. It is
characteristic of the age that it is not dealt with as a
matter of religion merely, but as a conspiracy&mdash;<i>coniuratio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">739</a>
This is the word used by Livy, and we find it also in
the document called <i>Senatusconsultum de Bacchanalibus</i>,
part of which has most fortunately come down to us.
This is the word also used, we may note, of the conspiracy
of Catiline in the century following, and it always conveys
the idea of <i>rebellion</i> against the order and welfare of the
State. In this case it was rebellion against the whole
body of the <i>mos maiorum</i>, the &#7972;&#952;&#959;&#987; of the City-state of
Rome. For it was an attempt to supersede the ancient
religious life of that State by <i>externa superstitio, prava
religio</i>&mdash;<i>prava</i>, because <i>deorum numen praetenditur sceleribus</i>;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>and hence, as Livy expresses it in the admirable
speech put into the mouth of the consul, the Roman gods
themselves felt their <i>numen</i> to be contaminated.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">740</a> All
the speeches in Livy, except perhaps the military ones,
are worth careful study by those who would enter into the
Roman spirit as conceived by an Augustan writer; and
this is one of the most valuable of them.</p>

<p>Lastly, let us note the steps taken by the government
in this emergency. It is treated as a matter of police,
both in Rome and Italy; the guilty are sought out and
punished as conspirators against the State, and a precedent
of tremendous force is hereby established for all
future dealings with <i>externa superstitio</i>, which held good
even to the last struggle with Christianity. Where foreign
rites are believed to be dangerous to the State or to
morality, they must be rigidly suppressed in the Roman
world; when they are harmless they may be tolerated,
or even, like the cult of the Magna Mater, received into
the sacred circle of Roman worships.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">741</a> But there is yet
another lesson to be learnt from the conduct of the
government at this crisis. Who would have suspected,
while reading the horrible story, and noting the almost
arbitrary energy with which the <i>coniuratio</i> was stamped
out, that the Dionysiac rites would even now be tolerated
under certain conditions? That this was so is a fact
attested not only by Livy, but by the <i>Senatusconsultum</i>
itself.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">742</a> The government was now forced to recognise the
fact that there were Romans for whom the <i>ius divinum</i>
no longer sufficed, and who needed a more emotional form
of religion. If any one (so ran in effect the <i>Senatusconsultum</i>)
felt conscientiously that he could not wholly
renounce the new religion, he might apply in person to
the praetor urbanus; and the praetor would lay the matter
before a meeting of the Senate, at which not less than a
hundred must be present. The Senate may give leave
for the worship, provided that no more than five persons
be present at it; and that there be no common fund for
its support, nor any permanent priest to preside at it.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>These clauses, says Aust,<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">743</a> are a concession to the strong
spiritual current of feeling which sought for something
fresher and better to take the place of the old religion of
forms; and on the whole we may agree with him. All
religious revivals are liable to be accompanied by moral
evil, but they all express unmistakably a natural and
honourable yearning of the human spirit.</p>

<p>Not long after this, in 181, the government put its
foot down firmly on what seems to have been another
attempt, though in this case a ludicrous one, to introduce
strange religious ideas at Rome. We have the story of
this on the authority not only of Livy, but of the oldest
Roman annalist, Cassius Hemina, from whose work Pliny
has preserved a fragment relating to this matter.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">744</a> Cassius
must almost certainly have been alive in 181, and would
remember the event;<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">745</a> and though his account and Livy's
differ in details, we may take the story as in the main
true. A secretary (<i>scriba</i>), who had land on the Janiculan
hill, dug up there a stone coffin with an inscription stating
that the king Numa was buried in it. No remains of a
body were found, but in a square stone casket inside the
coffin were found books written on paper (<i>charta</i>) and
supposed to be writings of Numa about the Pythagorean
philosophy. These writings were read by many people,
and eventually by a praetor, who at once pronounced
them to be subversive of religion. That anything supposed
to emanate from Numa should have this character was
of course impossible; and it is plain that the writings
were believed even at the time to be absurd forgeries,
drawn up with the idea of investing strange doctrines
with the authority of Numa's name; for the legend of a
religious connection between Numa and Pythagoras must
have been known at the time. The discoverer appealed
to the tribunes, who referred the matter to the senate;
and the senate authorised the praetor to burn the books
in the Comitium, which was done in the presence of a
large assembly.</p>

<p>In a later lecture I shall have something to say of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>revival of Pythagoreanism in the time of Cicero, and I
need not now attempt to explain what such a revival
might mean. All we need to note is that something
subversive of the Roman religion was believed to be
circulating in 181 in Roman society under the assumed
authority of Numa's name, and that the senate, warned
by recent experience, determined to stamp it out at once.
They seem to have suddenly become alive to the fact
that Greece, and in this instance mainly Magna Graecia,
was sending clever agents to Rome for the propagation
of ideas which might make the people less tractable to
authority. In the stress of the great war, indeed for years
afterwards, they had probably never had leisure to reflect
on the inevitable result of the writings of a man like
Ennius, who was not improbably responsible for the
propagation of these very Pythagorean notions.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">746</a> Now
a reaction seems to set in against the flowing tide of
admiration for everything Greek;<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">747</a> but it was too late
to arrest the flood. All that could be hoped for was that
in the lives and minds of the wiser Romans the new
Greek civilisation might so leaven the old Roman ignorance
that no permanent harm should be done to the
instincts of <i>virtus</i> and <i>pietas</i>: and to some extent this
hope was realised. But for the masses there was no such
hope. What Greek teaching reached their minds was
almost wholly that of the <i>ludi scenici</i>; and I must now
say a word in conclusion about this unwholesome influence&mdash;unwholesome,
that is, so far as it affected the
old religious ideas.</p>

<p>I had occasion, when dealing with Dr. Frazer's notion
that the Roman religion admitted such ideas as the
marriage of the gods with all its natural consequences,<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">748</a>
to point out that his evidence was almost wholly derived
from the play-writers of the very period on which we are
now engaged. I said that he seems to be justified in
concluding that there was a popular idea of such a kind,
which the State religion did not recognise; but that it
can very easily be explained as the natural effect of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>degenerate Greek mythology, popularised by Greek dramas
adapted to the Roman stage, upon certain peculiarities
of the Roman theology, and especially the functional
combination of male and female divine names in Italian
invocations of the deities. Nothing could be more
natural than that playwrights should take advantage of
such combinations to invent or translate comic passages
to please a Roman audience, "now largely consisting of
semi-educated men who had lost faith in their own religion,
and a host of smaller people of mixed descent and
nationality." We do not know enough of the older
comedies to be at all sure how far they had gone in this
direction, though we are certain, to use the words of
Zeller,<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">749</a> that it was impossible to transplant Greek poetry
to Roman soil without bringing Greek mythology with it;
or, as I should put it, without subordinating the old
reasonable idea of the Power manifesting itself in the
universe to the Greek fancy for clothing that Power in
the human form and endowing it with human faults and
frailties.</p>

<p>But of the two great literary figures of the age we
have now reached, Ennius and Plautus, we know beyond
all doubt that they taught the ignorant Roman of their
day not only to be indifferent to his deities, but to laugh
at them. Just at the very time when the forged books
of Numa were being burnt in the Comitium, Ennius'
famous translation of the <i>Sacred History of Euhemerus</i>
was becoming known at Rome, in which was taught the
doctrine of the human origin of all deities; and though
we have hardly a fragment left of the comedies of Ennius,
we may presume that he would not have hesitated for a
moment to make the gods ridiculous on the stage. It
was he who wrote the celebrated lines in his tragedy of
Telamo:<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">750</a></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">ego deum genus esse semper dixi et dicam caelitum,</span>
<span class="i0">sed eos non curare opinor quid agat humanum genus,</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>which (as I have said elsewhere)<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">751</a> strike a direct blow at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>the efficacy of sacrifice and prayer by openly declaring that
the gods did not interest themselves in mankind. This
is the same Epicurean doctrine afterwards preached by
Lucretius, and I must return to it in the next lecture.
At present let us select a couple of specimens of the
more explicit evidence of the extant plays of Plautus,
which began to be exhibited at Rome just about the end
of the war with Hannibal.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the way in which the family
relationships of Greek gods could be made amusing
under Roman names. Alcesimarchus in the <i>Cistellaria</i>
wishes to make a strong asseveration, and begins:<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">752</a></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">at ita me di deaeque, superi et inferi et medioxumi,</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>but immediately goes on to specify these deities more
particularly by their names and relationships&mdash;<i>and gets
the latter wrong</i>. Melaenis corrects him in a way which
(as Aust notes)<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">753</a> could only have seemed comical to a
Roman audience if they had already some acquaintance
with the divine family gossip.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">itaque me Iuno regina et Iovi' supremi filia</span>
<span class="i2">itaque me Saturnus eiius patruos&mdash;ME. ecastor, pater.</span>
<span class="i0">AL. itaque me Ops opulenta, illius avia&mdash;ME. immo mater quidem.</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Perhaps it was the fancy of the age for divine
genealogy that is here being made fun of rather than
the gods themselves; but in any case the passage shows
how irrecoverably lost was the real impersonal character
of the old Roman <i>numen</i>, and how impossible it must
have been in such an age to believe that anything was
really to be gained by the once solemn rites of the <i>ius
divinum</i>.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable evidence is in the Amphitruo,<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">754</a>
where Jupiter and Mercurius are among the
<i>dramatis personae</i>. This comedy is extremely amusing,
and was quite capable of entertaining the Parisians in
the form given it by Moli&egrave;re; but for them it could
hardly have been so funny as for the Greeks in the age
of the New Comedy and their disciples the Romans of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>Plautus' day, who saw Zeus and Hermes, Jupiter and
Mercurius, brought by their own misdoings into absurd
and degrading situations. Jupiter personates Amphitruo,
and so gains admission to his wife, Alkmene! Comment
is needless, unless we take the last line of the play as a
comment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nunc, spectatores, Iovi' summi causa clare plaudite!</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>I do not propose to follow further the downfall of the
old Roman ideas about the objects of worship, or the
neglect and decay of the <i>ius divinum</i>. They do not fall
within the scope of my subject&mdash;the religious experience
of the Roman people. So long as there was any life in
these ideas and in the cult which was the practical
expression of them, they formed part of that experience.
But I think I have sufficiently proved that the life has
gone out of the ideas, and that the worship has consequently
become meaningless. Ideas about the divine
may be discussed by philosophers as the Romans begin
to read and in some degree to think; and the outward
forms of the cult may be maintained in such particulars
as most closely concern the public life of the community;
but as a religious system expressing human experience
we have done with these things.</p>

may be worth noting that in xxxii. 30 we are told that a consul
vowed a temple to Juno Sospita, who had in her famous seat at
Lanuvium been a constant centre of marvel-mongering. Livy xxxiv.
53 places the building of this temple <i>in foro olitorio</i> three years
later, if we may read there Sospitae instead of the Matutae of the
MSS. with Sigonius: (cp. Aust, <i>de Aedibus</i>, p. 21, and Wissowa,
<i>R.K.</i> 117). This interesting deity had been taken into the Roman
worship in 338 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, but not moved from Lanuvium, which had
peculiar religious relations with Rome. See <i>Myth. Lex.</i> vol. ii.
p. 608, where the attributes of this Juno in art are described by
Vogel. The date of the temple at Rome was 194. Whether the
object of it was to diminish the portents at Lanuvium it is impossible
to say, but judging from the records of <i>prodigia</i> in Julius Obsequens
it had that effect. I find only four <i>prodigia</i> reported from Lanuvium
after this date.</p></div>

this story, which is not likely to have been invented. It can be
traced back to two writers, Oppius, the friend of Caesar, and Julius
Hyginus, the librarian of Augustus (Gell. vi. 1. 1), and was probably
based on tradition. Livy mentions it in xxvi. 19, and suggests that
this and other ways of Scipio were assumed to impress the multitude.
The Roman mind was naturally averse from such individualism in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>religion; but Scipio was beyond doubt more familiar than his
contemporaries with Greek ideas. In a chapter on Idealism in his
little book on <i>Religion and Art in Ancient Greece</i>, Professor
Ernest Gardner writes: "The statue (of Athene) by Phidias
within the Parthenon offered not merely that form in which she
would choose to appear if she showed herself to mortal eyes, but
actually showed her form as if she had revealed it to the sculptor.
To look upon such an image helped the worshipper as much as&mdash;perhaps
more than&mdash;any service or ritual, to bring himself into
communion with the goddess, and to fit himself, as a citizen of
her chosen city, to carry out her will in contributing his best
efforts to its supremacy in politics, in literature, and in art." That
Scipio had some feeling of this kind need not be doubted, though
the statue was not a great work of art like that of Phidias. Cp.
Lucretius, vi. 75 foll.</p></div>

<h4>LECTURE XVI</h4>

<h5>GREEK PHILOSOPHY AND ROMAN RELIGION</h5>

<p>I said at the end of the last lecture that ideas about the
Divine might be discussed at Rome by philosophers, as
the Romans began to read and in some degree to think.
At the era we have now reached, the latter half of the
second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, this process actually began, and I
propose in this lecture to deal with it briefly. But my
subject is the Roman religious experience, and I can only
find room for philosophy so far as the philosophy introduced
at Rome had a really religious side. Another
reason forbidding me to give much space to it is that it
was at Rome entirely exotic, did not spring from an
indigenous root in Roman life and thought, and never
seriously affected the minds of the lower and less educated
population. And I must add that the types of Greek
philosophy which concern us at all have been fully and
ably dealt with, the one in vol. ii. of Dr. Caird's lectures
on this foundation on <i>The Evolution of Theology in the
Greek Philosophers</i>, a work from which I have learnt
much, and the other by Dr. Masson in his most instructive
work on the great Epicurean poet Lucretius.</p>

<p>We have seen in the two last lectures that in that
second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> the Roman was fast becoming religiously
destitute&mdash;a castaway without consolation, and
without the sense that he needed it. He was destitute,
first, in regard to his idea of God and of his relation to
God; for if we take our old definition of religion, which
seems to me to be continually useful, we can hardly say of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>that age that it showed any effective desire to be in right
relation with the Power manifesting itself in the universe.
The old idea of the manifestation of the Power in the
various <i>numina</i> had no longer any relation to Roman
life; the kind of life in which it germinated and grew,
the life of agriculture and warlike self-defence, had passed
away with the growth of the great city, the decay of the
small farmer, and the extension of the empire; and no
new informing and inspiring principle had taken its place.
Secondly, he was destitute in regard to his sense of duty,
which had been largely dependent on religion, both in
the family and in the State. No new force had come in
to create and maintain conscience. In public life, indeed,
the religious oath was still powerful, and continued to be
so, though there are some signs that its binding force was
less strong than of yore, especially in the army.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">755</a> But in
a society so complex as that of Rome in the last two
centuries <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> much more was wanted than a bond sanctioned
by civil and religious law; there was needed a
sense of duty to the family, the slave, the provincials, the
poor and unfortunate. There was no spring of moral
action, no religious consecration of morality, no stimulus
to moral endeavour. The individual was rapidly developing,
emancipating himself from the State and the group-system
of society; but he was developing in a wrong
direction. The importance of self, when realised in high
and low alike, was becoming self-seeking, indifference to
all but self. We have now to see whether philosophy
could do anything to relieve this destitution of the
Romans in regard both to God and duty.</p>

<p>The first system of philosophy actually to make its
appearance at Rome was that of Epicurus<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">756</a>; but it
speedily disappeared for the time, and only became
popular in the last century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and then in its most
repulsive form. It was indeed destined to inspire the
noblest mind among all Roman thinkers with some of
the greatest poetry ever written; but I need say little
of it, for it was never really a part of Roman religious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>experience. Though capable of doing men much good in
a turbulent and individualistic age, it did not and could not
do this by establishing a religious sanction for conduct.
The Epicurean gods were altogether out of reach of the
conscience of the individual. They were superfluous
even for the atomic theory on which the whole system
was pivoted;<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">757</a> and what Epicurus himself understood
by them, or any of his followers down to Lucretius, is
matter of subtle and perplexing disputation.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">758</a> One point is
clear, that they had no interest in human beings;<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">759</a> and the
natural inference would be that human beings had no call
to worship them; yet, strange to say, Epicurus himself
took part in worship, and in the worship of the national
religion of his native city. Philodemus, the contemporary
of Lucretius, expressly asserts this,<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">760</a> and even insists that
Epicurism gave a religious sanction to morality which
was absent in Stoicism.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">761</a> Lucretius himself clearly
thought that worship was natural and possible. "If you
do not clear your mind of false notions," he says, "nec
delubra deum placido cum pectore adibis."<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">762</a> Man might
go on with his ancestral worship, but entirely without
fear, and as with "placid mind" he took part in the rites
of his fathers, a mysterious divine influence might enter
his mind; "the images of a Zeus, a Heracles, an Athene,
might pass in and impress on him the aspect and character
of each deity, and carry with them suggestions of virtue,
of courage, of wise counsel in difficulty."<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">763</a> Evidently
both Epicurus and his followers had felt the difficulty
and the peril of breaking entirely with the religious
habits of the mass of the people, and had conscientiously
done their best to reconcile their own belief with popular
practice&mdash;an attempt which has its parallel in the religious
speculation of the present day.</p>

<p>But for the Roman follower of Epicurus, wholly unused
to such subtle ideas as the passage of divine influence
into the mind by means of religious contemplation, this
lame attempt to bring apathetic gods into relation with
human life must have been quite meaningless. Cicero
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>well expresses the common sense of a Roman at the very
beginning of his treatise on the <i>Nature of the Gods</i>.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">764</a>
"If they are right who deny that the gods have any
interest in human affairs, where is there room for <i>pietas</i>,
for <i>sanctitas</i>, for <i>religio</i>?" What, he adds, is the use of
worship, of honour, of prayer? If these are simply
make-believes, <i>pietas</i> cannot exist, and with it we may
almost assume that <i>fides</i> and <i>iustitia</i>, and the social
virtues generally, which hold society together, must vanish
too. Such criticism is characteristically Roman, and we
may take it as representing accurately the feeling of the
old-fashioned Roman of Cicero's day, as well as of the
Stoic or Academic critic of Epicurism. On the other
hand, the believing Epicurean at Rome was not more
likely to accept the compromise; he had done with his
own gods and their worship, and such a "ficta simulatio"
was not likely to attract him. Even Lucretius, whose
mind was in a sense really religious, does no more in the
passage I quoted just now than <i>allude</i> to actual worship
of the gods, and he makes it quite clear that the tranquillity
and happiness coming from contemplation, and
the punishment that follows misdoing, are both purely
subjective; the gods are not active in influencing man's
life, but man influences that life himself by opening his
mind to the contemplation of the gods. This passage of
Lucretius (vi. 68 foll.) is, if I am not mistaken, the nearest
approach to real religion that we find in the history of
Roman Epicurism; yet so far as we know it bore no
fruit. It seems to me to express a genuine feeling, a
<i>religio</i>, but the expression is blurred by a consciousness
of inconsistency.</p>

<p>The fact is that in the system of Epicurus the Power
manifesting itself in the universe is not a divine Power,
but a mechanical one; the gods have nothing to do with
it, they cannot be active, their perfection is found in repose;
they are an adjunct, an after-thought in the system.
Thus all attempts to reconcile the Power with the popular
religion must inevitably be failures, and more especially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>so in the Roman world. At best the Epicurean gods
could but set an example of quietism which could not
possibly be a force for good in that active world of
business and government.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">765</a> The real force of Epicurism,
for the Roman at least, if I am not mistaken, was
<i>analogous</i> to a religious force, though far indeed from
being one in reality&mdash;I mean the profound and touching
belief in the Founder himself as a saviour, which is so
familiar to all readers of Lucretius.<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">766</a> And the real
legacy of Lucretius himself to Roman religion is only
indirectly a religious one&mdash;I mean the wholesome contempt
for "<i>superstitio</i>" and all the baser side of religious
belief and practice, old and new.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">767</a> If his devotion to the
Master had been rooted more in the love of goodness
and less in the admiration for his speculations, and if his
contempt for <i>superstitio</i> had been less harshly dogmatic,
had he been more sympathetic and generous in his
attitude to the Italian ideas of the divine&mdash;the power of
Lucretius might possibly have been strong and permanent.</p>

<p>Thus for the Roman's destitution in regard to God
Epicurism could find no remedy, and as a consequence
it could provide no religious sanction for his conduct in
life. What power it had upon conduct as a system of
ethics is a question outside the range of my subject. No
doubt a certain type of mind, naturally pure and good,
and apt to retire upon itself, might find in Epicurism
not only no harm but even positive help; perhaps the
best way to appreciate this fact, too often overlooked, is
to read the defence of the Epicurean ethics put into the
mouth of Torquatus, in the first book of the <i>de Finibus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">768</a>
by one who was far from being in sympathy with the
creed. But for the Roman of that age, when ideas of
duty and discipline were losing strength, this enticing
faith, with pleasure as its <i>summum bonum</i>, and with
quietism as its ideal of human life,<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">769</a> could hardly be
a real stimulus to active virtue; the Roman needed
bracing, and this was not a tonic, but a sedative. Far
more valuable in every way, and far better suited to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>best instincts of the Roman character, was the rival creed
of Stoicism, and I must devote the rest of this lecture to
the consideration of its religious aspect.</p>

<p>It was most fortunate for Rome that her best and
ablest men in the second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> fell into the hands,
not of Epicureans, but of Stoics&mdash;into the hands, too, of a
single Stoic of high standing, fine character, and good
sense. For destitute as the Roman was both in regard
to God and to Duty, he found in Stoicism an explanation
of man's place in the universe,&mdash;an explanation relating
him directly to the Power manifesting itself therein, and
deriving from that relation a <i>binding</i> principle of conduct
and duty. This should make the religious character of
Stoicism at once apparent. It is perfectly true, as the
late Mr. Lecky said long ago,<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">770</a> that "Stoicism, taught
by Panaetius of Rhodes, and soon after by the Syrian
Posidonius, became the true religion of the educated
classes. It furnished the principles of virtue, coloured
the noblest literature of the time, and guided all the
developments of moral enthusiasm." To this I only
need to add that it woke in the mind an entirely new
idea of Deity, far transcending that of Roman <i>numina</i>
and of Greek polytheism, and yet not incapable of being
reconciled with these; so that it might be taken as an
inpouring of sudden light upon old conceptions of the
Power, glorifying and transfiguring them, rather than,
like the Epicurean faith, a bitter and contemptuous negation
of man's inherited religious instincts. But before
we go on to consider this illumination more closely, let
me say a few words about Panaetius the Stoic missionary,
and Scipio Aemilianus, his most famous disciple.</p>

<p>Scipio, born 184, was a happy combination of the
best Roman aristocratic character and the receptive intelligence
which for a Roman was the chief result of a
Greek liberal education. He had been educated by his
famous father, Aemilius Paulus, in a thoroughly healthy
way; he was no mere book-student, but a practical
courageous Roman, with a solid mental foundation of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>moral rectitude (<i>pietas</i>) fixed firmly in the traditions and
instincts of his own family. On this foundation, as has
been well said,<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">771</a> a superstructure of intellectual culture
might be built securely without destroying it, and this
was exactly what did take place, both for Scipio and for
that circle of friends of his which has become so famous
in Roman history. In very early life he became the
intimate friend of Polybius, whose account of their first
unreserved intercourse is one of the most delightful passages
in all ancient literature;<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">772</a> and from Polybius he
doubtless learnt to think. He must have learnt to understand
the real nature of the Roman empire, to appreciate
the forces which had called it into being,<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">773</a> the qualities
which had preserved it through the fearful struggle with
Hannibal, and the duty of a noble Roman in regard to
it. From Polybius, indeed, it is not likely that he gained
much light on matters either of religion or morality; but
that statesman and historian must inevitably have accustomed
him, in the course of their long intercourse, to think
more deeply than Roman had ever yet thought, about
the world in which he lived and was to act for many
years the leading part. Thus he was well prepared for
the friendship of a more spiritual guide.</p>

<p>Panaetius, who was probably about the same age as
Scipio, had the advantage, as a visitor at Rome, of being
a Rhodian, <i>i.e.</i> a citizen of the one Greek State which had
been almost continuously on good terms with Rome, and
of great value to her. He was also a scion of an old and
honoured family in that city, and was thus in every way
a fit friend and companion for a great Roman noble.
When their friendship began we do not know for certain;
but it is a fact that he lived for some two years, together
with Polybius, in the house of Scipio, and these years
were probably between 144 and 141 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, after Scipio's
return from the conquest of Carthage.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">774</a> When Scipio in
141 was commissioned by the Senate to go and set
things in order in the eastern Mediterranean, he took
Panaetius with him,<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">775</a> and brought him home to live with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>him again as a guest, perhaps until he left for the Numantine
war in 134, after which it is not likely that they met
again before Scipio's sudden death in 129. I am particular
about the extent of their intimacy, because I wish
to make it clear that this was no ordinary or fleeting
friendship between a commonplace Greek philosopher
and an average Roman statesman. Both statesman and
philosopher were far above the usual level of their kind,
and in the course of this long intimacy must have had
full opportunity of learning from each other. From
Scipio Panaetius would learn the secrets of the Roman
temperament, and divine the right methods of dealing
with it, and the result of this was a happy modification
of the old rigidity of the Stoic principles&mdash;an adaptation
of them to the Roman character which had far-reaching
consequences. From Panaetius Scipio and his friends
would learn a new and illuminating conception of man's
place in the universe, and of his relation to the Power
manifested in it. To understand the power of Stoicism
on the mind of these Romans and their intellectual
successors, it is necessary to have a clear idea of this
illumination.</p>

<p>Hitherto there had been nothing in the religion of
Rome, or of any other city-state, to make it inevitable,
reasonable, that man should worship the Power, except
tradition and self-interest, involved in the tradition and
self-interest of the family and the city. The gods belonged,
as we saw, to family or city as divine inhabitants,
and if you neglected them they would show their anger
against you. Originally it was <i>religio</i>, the feeling of awe
for something distinct from man and unknown to him,
which forced him to propitiate that which he might fear,
but had no reason, except the instinct of self-preservation,
to reverence; and later on, as he came to know his
<i>numina</i> better, to make them, so to speak, his own, and
to formulate the methods of propitiating them, he gradually
came also to take them for granted, and to worship
them as a matter of traditional duty. The idea of conforming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>his life to the will of any of these <i>numina</i> would,
of course, be absolutely strange to him&mdash;the expression
would have no meaning whatever for him. The help
which he sought from them was not moral help, but
material.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">776</a> But now, when the <i>religio</i> has been hypnotised
and soothed away, and when the tradition of ceremonial
observance was growing dim and weak, when he is left
alone with his fellow-men, and without any binding
reason for right conduct towards them, he may learn
from Stoicism that there is a Power above and beyond
all his <i>numina</i>, yet involving and embracing them all, to
which, and by the help of which, as a man endowed with
reason, he <i>must</i> conform his life.</p>

<p>The theology held and taught by Panaetius, in common
with all Stoics at all periods, was based upon two leading
thoughts, in the correlation of which lay the kernel of the
Stoic ethical system. The first of these thoughts is this:
the whole universe, in all its forms and manifestations,
shows unmistakably the work of Reason, of Mind; without
mind, reason, <i>spiritus</i>, as Cicero calls it,<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">777</a> the universe
could not exist. I need not go here into the origin and
history of this thought; what is important for us is to
make clear the theological consequences of it. Obviously
it was natural that the Stoic should be led on to the
conviction that this universe endowed with Reason&mdash;with
a Reason far transcending all human capacity&mdash;must
itself be God. The Stoic arguments in support of
this further step are indeed lame, as they inevitably must
be; they are well set forth at the beginning of Book ii.
of Cicero's work <i>de Natura Deorum</i> (based upon one by
Posidonius, the successor and disciple of Panaetius), where
they seem to us rather cold and formal. That step is
indeed incapable of being made convincing by any
syllogism; it is only when we try to think with the
minds of those old thinkers, living in a world of unmeaning
worship, that we begin to realise the nobility of a
conviction which they tried in vain to reduce to a
syllogism. <i>Sapiens a principio mundus, et deus habendus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>est</i>;<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">778</a> these words, which sound like an article of a creed,
suffice for us without the laborious arguments of Cleanthes
and Chrysippus which we may read in the fifth and sixth
chapters of Cicero's book. Cicero has added to these a
characteristic illustration from city life, which I may
quote as more useful for us. "If a man enters a house
or a gymnasium or a forum, and sees reason, method,
and discipline reigning there, he cannot suppose that
these came about without a cause, but perceives that
there is someone there who rules and is obeyed: how
much more, when he contemplates the motions and
revolutions to be seen in the universe (<i>e.g.</i>, in the heavenly
bodies), must he conclude that they are all governed by
a conscious Mind!" And this Mind can be nothing
else but God.</p>

<p>This sounds like the Deism of the eighteenth century,
and might be described as "natural religion"; but the
Stoics took yet another step, and developed their thought
into Pantheism. The idea of a personal Deity, distinct
from the universe and its Creator, was obnoxious to them;
it would have committed them to a dualism of Mind and
Matter which, from the very outset of their history, they
emphatically repudiated; their conviction was of a Unity
in all things, and to this they consistently held in spite
of constant and damaging criticism. The theological
result of this conviction has lately been well expressed
by Dr. Bussell.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">779</a> He is speaking of Seneca in particular,
but what he says applies to all Stoics equally well:
"Though he yearns to see God in 'the moral order of
the Universe,' he is forced in the interests of Unity to
identify Him with every other known force. As He is
everything, so any name will suit Him. He is the sum of
existence: or the secret and abstract law which guides it:
He is Nature or Fate. The partial names of special
deities are all His, and together they make up the fulness
of the divine title; but <i>they disappear in the immense
nothingness</i>, rather than colour or qualify it." This is a
point of immense importance for the study of Stoicism at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>Rome; it was fully developed by Posidonius, and copied
from him both by Cicero and Varro. "God," says Cicero
in the book I have been quoting, "pervading all nature
(<i>pertinens per naturam cuiusque rei</i>), can be understood as
Ceres on the land, as Neptune on the sea, and so on, and
may be and should be worshipped in all these different
forms;" not in superstitious fear and grovelling spirit&mdash;the
mental attitude which Lucretius had condemned
years before this treatise was written&mdash;but with pure
heart and mind, following the one and true God in all
his various manifestations.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">780</a> Thus the Stoic Pantheism,
in spite of its weak points, could find room for the deities
of the city-state, and put new illuminating life into them.
To us it may seem, as it seems to Dr. Bussell, that they
would disappear in an immense nothingness; but to the
Roman mind of Scipio's age, if I am not mistaken, they
might, on the contrary, save the great Pantheistic idea
from so itself disappearing. I cannot but think that the
Roman's idea of divinity, the force or will-power which
he called <i>numen</i>,<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">781</a> would find here a means of reviving
its former hold on the Roman mind, and enabling it to
grasp as a concrete fact, and not merely as an abstract
idea, the "deus pertinens per naturam cuiusque rei." In
particular the Roman conception of the great Jupiter, the
father of heaven, might gain new life for the people who
had so long been used to call him "the Best and
Greatest." Almost from the very beginning of Stoicism
the school had seized upon Zeus to convey, under the guise
of a personality and a name, some idea of the Reason in
the universe;<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">782</a> and the same use might just as well,
perhaps even better, be made of the great deity of the
Capitoline temple, whom his people recognised as the
open heaven with all its manifestations, the celestial
representative of good faith and righteous dealing, and
the special protector of the destinies of Rome and her
empire.</p>

<p>The second thought which lies at the base of the
religion or theology of Stoicism, is this: that Man himself,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>alone in all the Universe, shares with God the full
possession of Reason. In other words, Man alone, besides
God, is strictly individual, self-conscious, capable of realising
an end and of working towards it; he is so utterly
different from the animals, so far above them (or if we
call him an animal, he is, in Cicero's language,<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">783</a> <i>animal
providum, sagax, multiplex, acutum, memor, plenum
rationis et consilii</i>), that he must surely be of the same
nature as God. And this is what, in strict conformity
with all Stoic teaching, Cicero in this same passage expressly
says&mdash;man is <i>generatus a deo</i>. So too in the
famous hymn of Cleanthes,<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">784</a> quoted by St. Paul at
Athens ("For we are also his offspring,"):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Chiefest glory of deathless Gods, Almighty for ever,</span>
<span class="i0">Sovereign of Nature that rulest by law, what name shall we give thee?</span>
<span class="i0">Blessed be Thou, for on Thee should call all things that are mortal.</span>
<span class="i0">For that we are Thy offspring: nay, all that in myriad motion</span>
<span class="i0">Lives for its day on the earth bears one impress, Thy likeness, upon it;</span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore my song is of Thee, and I hymn Thy power for ever.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In these splendid lines it is plain that not Man only is
thought of, but all living things, animals included with
Man; and this is in accordance with the true Stoic Pantheism.
But none the less on this account did the Stoics
believe Man to be the one living thing in the universe
comparable with God, and capable of communion with
him by virtue of the possession of Reason. As Cicero
says, a few lines farther on in the work I am quoting,
"virtus eadem in homine ac deo est, neque ullo alio
ingenio praeterea." And since every creature seeks to
maintain and augment its own being, to bring it to
perfection, to express it fully, by an innate law of its
nature, Man being endowed with Reason above all other
creatures, strives, or should strive, to bring himself to a
perfect expression, by identifying himself with the divine
principle which he shares with God. As Dr. Caird puts
it,<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">785</a> "the ruling power of Reason so dominates his nature
that he cannot be described as anything but a self-conscious
<i>ego</i> (<i>i.e.</i> in contrast with other animals); and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>just because of this, all his impulses become concentrated
in one great effort after self-realisation." But the self
that he tries to realise must be his true self, not his
irrational impulses: the self which is a part of the divine
principle. He must desire to realise himself as having
Reason, and so to come into close communion with God,
the Reason of the universe. Those who are at all
familiar with the later Roman Stoics, Seneca and Marcus
Aurelius, and Epictetus, if we may include him among
them, will recognise in this inspiring thought, vague and
impalpable as it may seem, the germ of many beautiful
expressions of the relation of Man to God, which
seem to bring Stoicism into closer spiritual connection
with Christianity than any other doctrine of the ancient
world.</p>

<p>The work of Cicero from which I have been quoting,
the first book of his treatise on the Laws, <i>i.e.</i> the Roman
constitution, is very probably based on one by Panaetius
himself,<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">786</a> of whom we are expressly told that he used
to discuss that constitution together with Polybius and
Scipio in the days of their happy intimacy at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">787</a>
In any case we may find it helpful, taken together with
the earlier fragmentary work <i>de Republica</i>, in trying to
form some idea of the effect of this second leading Stoic
thought on the best Roman minds of the last ages of the
Republic. We find, as we might expect, that it is not
on Man simply as individual that stress is here laid.
Man is not thought of as hoping to realise his own
Reason in isolation; the Stoics, though, like their rivals,
they represent a reaction of the individual against the
State, were all along perfectly clear that man in isolation
would be helpless, and that his own reason bade him
realise himself in association with his fellow-men.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">788</a> It
is the position of Man, as associated, 1, with God, 2, with
other men, that is here made prominent; and the bond
of connection is in each case Law, which is indeed only
one name for the Supreme Reason and the highest Good.
I must say a word about these two aspects of Man's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>position in the world, in order to explain what I believe
to have been the effect of this teaching on the Roman
mind.</p>

<p>1. In explaining the relation of Man to God Cicero
uses an expression which some years before he had developed
in a fine passage in the Republic: <i>true law</i>, he
says, <i>is right reason</i>.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">789</a> In the Laws he takes it up again,
and argues that as both God and Man have reason, there
must be a direct relation between them.<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">790</a> And as Law
and right reason are identical, we may say that Law is
the binding force of that relation. And again, this means
that the universe may be looked on as one great State
(<i>civitas</i>), of which both God and Man (or gods and men)
are citizens, or in another way as a State of which the
constitution is itself the Reason, or God's law, which all
reasonable beings must obey. Such obedience is itself
the effort by which Man realises his own reason: he is a
part of a reasonable universe, and he cannot rebel against
its law without violating his own highest instinct. It is
not hard to see how this way of expressing the Stoic
theological principle would appeal to the Roman mind.
That mind was wholly incapable of metaphysical thinking;
but it could without effort understand, with the help
of its social and political principles and experience, the
idea of supreme intelligent rule&mdash;a supreme <i>imperium</i>, as
it were, to rebel against which would be a moral <i>perduellio</i>,
high treason against a supreme Law, unwritten like his
own, and resting, as he thought of his own as resting, on
the best instincts, tradition, reason, of his community;
from his own constitution and laws he could lift his mind
without much difficulty to the constitution and law of the
<i>communis deorum et hominum civitas</i>. The idea of God
in any such sense as this was indeed new to him; but he
could grasp it under the expression "universal law of
right reason" when he would have utterly failed, for
example, to conceive of it as "the Absolute." He can
feel himself the citizen of a State whose maker and ruler
is God, and whose law is the inevitable force of Reason;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>he can realise his relationship to God as a part of the
same State, gifted with the same power of discerning its
legal basis, nay, even helping to administer its law by
rational obedience.</p>

<p>2. Reason as thus ruling the universe can also provide
a basis for Man's reasonable association with his fellow-men,
and a religious basis if conceived as God; for
Man's recognition of the divine law, the <i>recta ratio</i>, as
binding on him, is followed quite naturally by his recognition
of the application of that law to the world he lives
in. "Human law comes into existence," says Zeller,
explaining this point,<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">791</a> "when man becomes aware of the
divine law, and recognises its claim on him." Here,
again, it is easy to see how illuminating would be this
conception of law for the Roman of Scipio's time. So
far the Roman idea and study of law (as I have elsewhere
expressed it)<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">792</a> had been of a crabbed, practical character,
wanting in breadth of treatment, destitute of any philosophical
conception of the moral principles which lie
behind all law and government. The new doctrine called
up life in these dry bones, and started Roman lawyers,
many of whom were Stoics more or less pronounced, on
a career of enlightened legal study which has left one of
the most valuable legacies inherited by the modern world
from ancient civilisation. In another way too it had, I
think, an immediate effect on Scipio himself and his
circle, and on their mental descendants, of whom Cicero
was the most brilliant: it made them look on the law and
constitution of their State as eminently reasonable, and
on rebellion against it as unreason, or as the Romans call
it, <i>lascivia</i>, wanton disregard of principle. So far as I
know, no great Roman lawyer was ever a revolutionary
like Catiline or Clodius, nor yet an obstinate conservative
like Cato, whose Stoicism was of the older and less
Romanised type; the two of whom we know most in
the century following the arrival of Panaetius were both
wise, just, and moderate men, Mucius Scaevola and
Servius Sulpicius, of whom it may be truly said they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>contributed as much to civilisation as the great military
and political leaders of the same period.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">793</a></p>

<p>There now remains the question whether this noble
Stoic religion, as we may fairly call it, with its ideas of
the relation of Man to God and to his fellow-men, had,
after all, sufficient definiteness for a Roman to act as a grip
on his conscience and his conduct in his daily dealings
with others. It could deduce the existence and beauty
of the social virtues from its own principles; if Man partakes
of the eternal Reason, or, as they otherwise put it,
if he is through his Reason a part of God himself in the
highest sense, and if God and Reason are in the highest
sense good, then in realising his own Reason, in obeying
the voice of the God within him,<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">794</a> he must be himself
good by the natural instinct of his own being. Accordingly,
these social virtues, duties, <i>officia</i>, as the Romans
called them, were set forth by Panaetius in two books,
which in a Latinised form we still fortunately possess,&mdash;the
first two of Cicero's work <i>de Officiis</i>,&mdash;and without
the uncompromising rigidity which characterised the
original Stoic ethical doctrine inherited from the Cynics.<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">795</a>
In the first book he treated of the good simply (<i>honestum</i>),
in the second of the useful (<i>utile</i>), and in a third, which it
was left for Cicero to execute, of the cases of conflict
between these two. In this charming work there is much
to admire, and even much to learn: the social virtues&mdash;benevolence,
justice, liberality, self-restraint, and so on,
are enlarged upon and illustrated by historical examples<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">796</a>
in perfect Latin by Cicero; and as we read it we cannot
but feel that the influence of Panaetius upon his educated
Roman pupils must have been eminently wholesome.</p>

<p>But at the same time we inevitably feel that there is
something wanting. What power could such a discussion
really have to constrain an ordinary man to right action?
The constraint, such as it is, seems purely an intellectual
process, and this is indeed noticeable in the Stoic ethics
of all periods. No Stoic brought his doctrine nearer to a
religious system than Epictetus; yet this is how Epictetus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>puts the matter:<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">797</a> "If a man could be thoroughly penetrated,
as he ought to be, with this <i>thought</i>, that we are
all in an especial manner sprung from God, and that God
is the Father of men as well as gods, full sure he would
never conceive aught ignoble or base of himself.... Those
few who <i>hold</i> that they are born for fidelity,
modesty, and unerring rightness in dealing with the things
of sense, never conceive aught base or ignoble of themselves."
He means that, for the real Stoic, <i>self-respect is
the necessary consequence of his intellectual conception of his
place in the universe</i>, and that self-respect must as inevitably
result in virtue. Can this intellectual attitude really
act as a constraining force on the will of the average
man? This is far too complicated a question for me
to enter upon here, and I can but suggest the study of
it for anyone who would wish to test the actual life-giving
moral power of this philosophy. Suffice it to
say that their idea of the universe as Reason and God
naturally led the Stoics into a kind of Fatalism, a destined
order in the world which nothing could effectually oppose;<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">798</a>
and they were naturally in some difficulty in reconciling
this with the freedom of Man's will. That freedom they
constantly and consistently asserted; but it comes after
all to this, that Man is free to bring his will into conformity,
<i>through knowledge</i>, with the Power and the universal
Reason; or, as Dr. Caird puts it,<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">799</a> Man has the
choice whether he will be a willing or an unwilling servant
(of the universal Reason): unwilling, if he makes it his
aim to satisfy his particular self, an aim which he can
only attain so far as the general system of things allows
him; willing, if he identifies himself with the divine
reason which is manifested in that system." But that
identification of himself with the divine Reason is again
an intellectual process; it can only be realised by minds
highly trained in thinking; it could not have the smallest
grip on the conduct of the ordinary ignorant man, or on
the minds of women and children.</p>

<p>And here we come upon another weak point in Stoicism
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>as presented to the Roman world in this last century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
It was an age in which gentleness, tenderness, pity, and
the philanthropic spirit were most sadly needed, and it
cannot be said of Stoicism that it had any mission to
encourage their growth. The Stoics looked on the mass
of men as ignorant and wicked,<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">800</a> and it never occurred to
them that it was a duty of the Good Man to teach and
redeem them,&mdash;to sacrifice his life, if need be, in the work
of enlightenment. They seem to have thought even of
women and children as hardly partaking of Reason; their
ideally good man was virtuous in a strictly virile way,<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">801</a>
and it never occurred to them that training in goodness
must begin from the earliest years, and be gradually
developed with infinite sympathy and tenderness. If a
man is to learn that there is something within him which
partakes of God, and which should naturally lead him to
right conduct, he must begin to learn this truth in his
infancy.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">802</a> But the absence of a place for emotion and
sympathy in the Stoic system, resulting from the purely
intellectual nature of their central doctrine of Reason,
meant also the absence of any spirit of enthusiastic propaganda.
Their notion that emotion or passion is "a movement
of mind contrary to reason and nature,"<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">803</a> lamed
their whole system as a progressive force in the world of
that day. Such religious power as it could exercise
worked simply through the radiating influence of a few
wise and good men, by nature pure and unselfish, who
gradually familiarised the educated part of society with a
nobler idea of God than the old religion had ever been
able to supply, and with that other inspiring idea of the
near relation of Man to God as partaking of His nature.
But the active enthusiasm of a real religion&mdash;the <i>effective</i>
desire to be in right relation with the Power&mdash;was strange
to Stoicism. In one way or another it had many excellent
results; it cleared the ground, for example, for a
new and universal religion by putting into the shade, if
not altogether out of the way, the old local cults with
their narrow and limited civic force: it glorified the idea
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>of law and order in an age when the Roman world
seemed to be forgetting what these sacred words meant;
<i>but a real active enthusiasm of humanity was wanting in it</i>.
Hence there is a certain hopelessness about Stoicism,
which increased rather than diminished as the world went
on, and such as is seen in a kind of sad grandeur in
Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic emperor. Of him it may be
said, both as emperor and philosopher, as has been said
of the Stoic in general, that "he was essentially a soldier
left to hold a fort surrounded by overpowering hosts of
the enemy. He could not conquer or drive them away,
but he could hold out to the last and die at his post."</p>

argues that the exordium of Bk. iii. indicates a psychological conversion
of Lucretius.</p></div>

personality of Lucretius. <i>Social Life at Rome in the Age of Cicero</i>,

downrightness, and audacity of its system, working on minds weary

Camb. Univ. Press). The following sentence in ch. 18, sec. 57,
puts the Epicurean ethics in a nutshell: "Clamat Epicurus, is quem
vos nimis voluptatibus esse deditum dicitis, non posse iucunde vivi
nisi sapienter, honeste, iusteque vivatur, nec sapienter, honeste, iuste,
nisi iucunde."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_769_769" id="Footnote_769_769"></a><a href="#FNanchor_769_769"><span class="label">769</span></a> What this quietism might mean for a Roman may be
gathered from the following passage in Cic. <i>de Finibus</i>, i. 13. 43, in
which <i>sapientia</i> is practical wisdom, the Aristotelian &#966;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#987; or the
<i>ars vivendi</i>, as Cicero has explained it just before: "Sapientia est
adhibenda, quae, et terroribus cupiditatibusque detractis et omnium
falsarum opinionum temeritate derepta, certissimam se ducem praebeat
ad voluptatem. Sapientia enim est una, quae maestitiam pellat ex
animis, quae nos exhorrescere metu non sinat; qua praeceptrice in
tranquillitate vivi potest, omnium cupiditatum ardore restincto. Cupiditates
enim sunt insatiabiles, quae non modo singulos homines, sed
universas familias evertunt, totam etiam labefactant saepe rempublicam.
Ex cupiditatibus odia discidia discordiae seditiones bella nascuntur."
And so on to the end of the chapter. The message of Lucretius to
the Roman was practically the same. The remedy was the wrong
one in that age; though it does not necessarily entail withdrawal
from public life with all its enticements and risks, it must inevitably
have a strong tendency to suggest it; and such withdrawal had, as
a matter of fact, been one of the characteristics of the Epicurean
life. See Zeller, <i>Stoics</i>, etc., ch. xx.; Guyau, <i>La Morale d'&Eacute;picure</i>,

better understand this notion of his Reason as the voice of God
within him, or conscience, from his own idea of his "other soul," or
genius; see above, p. 75. But we do not know for certain that it
was presented to him in this way by Panaetius, though Posidonius
(<i>ap. Galenum</i>, 469) used the word &#948;&#945;&#7985;&#956;&#969;&#957; in this sense, as did the
later Stoics; see Mulder, <i>de Conscientiae notione</i>, p. 71. Seneca,
<i>Ep.</i> 41. 2, uses the word <i>spiritus</i>: "Sacer intra nos spiritus sedet ...
in unoquoque virorum bonorum, quis deus incertum est, habitat deus"
(from Virg. <i>Aen.</i> viii. 352). Cp. Marcus Aurelius iii. 3. Seneca
uses the word genius clearly in this sense in <i>Ep.</i> 110 foll. On the
Stoic daemon consult Zeller, <i>Stoics</i>, etc., p. 332 foll.; Oakesmith,

educational value of its own, but serves well to show how comparatively
feeble was the appeal of Stoicism to the conscience. It may
be seen well in Valerius Maximus, whose work, compiled of fact and
fiction for educational purposes, is far indeed from being an inspiring
one. See <i>Social Life at Rome</i>, p. 189.</p></div>

<h4>LECTURE XVII</h4>

<h5>MYSTICISM&mdash;IDEAS OF A FUTURE LIFE</h5>


<p>We have now reached the end of the period of the
Republic; but before I go on to the age of Augustus,
with which I must bring these lectures to an end, I must
ask attention to a movement which can best be described
by the somewhat vague term Mysticism, but is generally
known to historians of philosophy as Neo-pythagoreanism.
The fact is that such tendency as there ever was at Rome
towards Mysticism&mdash;which was never indeed a strong
one till Rome had almost ceased to be Roman<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">804</a>&mdash;seems
to have taken the form of thinking known as Pythagorean.
The ideas at the root of the Pythagorean doctrine, the
belief in a future life, the conception of this life as only
preparatory to another, the conviction of the need of
purgation in another life and of the preparatory discipline
and asceticism to be practised while we are here,&mdash;these
are truly religious ideas; and even among Romans the
religious instinct, though it might be hypnotised, could
never be entirely destroyed. When it awoke from time
to time in the minds of thinking men it was apt to
express itself in Pythagorean tones. With the ignorant
and vulgar it might find a baser expression in superstition
pure and simple,&mdash;in the finding of portents, in astrology,
in Dionysiac orgies; but with these Pythagoreanism must
not be reckoned. These, as they appeared on the soil of
Italy, were the bastard children of quasi-religious thought.
But the movement of which I speak marks a reaction,
among men who could both feel and think, against the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>whole tendency of Roman religious experience as we have
been tracing it; against the extreme formalism, now
meaningless, of the Roman State religion; against the
extreme scepticism and indifference so obvious in the last
century and a half of the republican era; against the
purely intellectual appeal of the ethical systems of which
I have been recently speaking. Stoicism indeed, as we
shall see, held out a hand to the new movement, simply
because Stoicism had a religious side which was wanting
in Epicurism. But the thought that our senses and our
reason are not after all the sole fountains of our knowledge,
a thought which is the essence of mysticism, was
really foreign to Stoicism; and when this thought did
find a soil in the mind of a thinking Roman of this age,
it was likely to spring up in a transcendental form which
we may call Pythagoreanism.</p>

<p>South Italy was indeed the true home of the
Pythagorean teaching. There its founder had established
it, and there, mixed up with more popular Orphic doctrine
and practice, it must have remained latent for centuries.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">805</a>
"Tenuit magnam illam Graeciam," says Cicero of Pythagoras,
"cum honore disciplinae, tum etiam auctoritate;
multaque saecula post sic viguit Pythagoreorum nomen,
ut nulli alii docti viderentur."<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">806</a> To South Italy Plato is
said to have travelled to study this philosophy, and to
learn the doctrine of the immortality of the soul; and the
story is generally accepted as true.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">807</a> But of any missionary
attempt of Pythagoreanism on Rome we know nothing&mdash;and
probably there was nothing to tell&mdash;till that mysterious
plot to introduce it after the Hannibalic war which I
mentioned in a recent lecture.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">808</a> That war brought Rome
into close contact with Tarentum and southern Italy, and
it is likely enough that the attempt to connect King Numa
with the philosopher, both in the familiar legend and in
the alleged discovery of the stone coffin with its forged
manuscripts, had its origin in this contact. The Senate
could not object to the legend, but it promptly stamped
out this grotesque attempt at propagandism. Then we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>hear no more of the doctrine for a century at least; but
in the last century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> we know that there appeared a
number of Pythagorean writings, falsely attributed to the
founder himself or his disciples,<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">809</a>&mdash;a method of propagandism
which, like that of the previous century, may
perhaps be taken as marking the religious nature of the
doctrine, which needed the <i>ipse dixit</i> of the founder or
something as near it as possible.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">810</a> But of the immediate
influence of these writings we know nothing. The person
really responsible for the tendency to this kind of mysticism
was undoubtedly the great Posidonius, philosopher,
historian, traveller, who more than any other man
dominated the Roman world of thought in the first half
of the last century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and whose writings, now surviving
in a few fragments only, lie at the back of nearly all the
serious Roman literature of his own and indeed of the
following age.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">811</a> Panaetius, there can be little doubt,
had done something to leaven Stoicism with Platonic-Aristotelian
psychology,<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">812</a> the general tendency of which
was towards a dualism of Soul and Body. The Stoics, in
the strict sense of the name, "could not be content with
any philosophy which divided heaven from earth, the
spiritual from the material." "They rebelled against the
idea of a transcendent God and a transcendent ideal
world, as modern thought has rebelled against the supernaturalism
of mediaeval religion and philosophy."<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">813</a> In
their passion for unity they would not separate soul and
body. But when once Panaetius had hinted at a reversion
to the older mode of thought, it was natural and easy to
follow his lead in a society which had long ago abandoned
burial for cremation, and bidden farewell to the primitive
notion that the body lived on under the earth: in a society,
too, which had always believed in that "other soul," the
<i>Genius</i> of a man, as distinct from his bodily self of this
earthly life.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">814</a></p>

<p>Now as soon as this dualism of body and soul was
suggested, it was taken up by Posidonius into what we
may call his neo-Stoic system, and at once gave mysticism,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>&mdash;or transcendentalism, if we choose so to call it&mdash;its
chance. For in such a dualistic psychology it is the soul
that gains in value, the body that loses. Life becomes
an imprisonment of the soul in the body; the soul seeks
to escape, death is but the beginning of a new life, and
the imagination is set to work to fathom the mysteries of
Man's future existence, nay, in some more fanciful minds,
those of his pre-existence as well. This kind of speculation,
half philosophic, half poetical, is the transcendental
side of the Platonic psychology, and in the last age of
the Republic was able to connect Platonism and Pythagoreanism
without deserting Stoicism.<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">815</a> We can see it
reflected from Posidonius in the Dream of Scipio, the
beautiful myth, imitated from those of Plato, with which
Cicero concluded his treatise on the State, written in the
year 54 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, after his retirement from political life. In
this, and again in the first book of his <i>Tusculan
Disputations</i>, composed nearly ten years later, Cicero is
beyond doubt on the tracks of Posidonius, and therefore
also of Pythagoreanism.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">816</a> Listen to the words put into the
mouth of the elder Scipio and addressed to his younger
namesake: "Tu vero enitere et sic habeto, non esse te
mortalem, sed corpus hoc; non enim tu es, quem forma
ista declarat; sed <i>mens cuiusque is est quisque</i>, non ea
figura quae digito demonstrari potest."<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">817</a> Here is the body
plainly losing, the soul gaining importance. But he goes
still further: "<i>deum igitur te scito esse</i>: si quidem deus
est qui viget qui sentit qui meminit: qui providet, qui
tam regit et moderatur et movet id corpus cui propositus
est, quam hunc mundum ille princeps deus, et ut mundum
ex quadam parte mortalem ipse deus aeternus, sic fragile
corpus animus sempiternus movet."<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">818</a></p>

<p>With such a view of the soul in relation to the body, we
can understand how in this myth it is described as flying
upwards, released from corporeal bondage, and ascending
through heavenly stations to pure aether, if at least (and
here we may note the characteristic Roman touch) its abode
on earth has been the body of a good citizen.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">819</a> All that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>is of earth earthy, all old ideas of burial, all notions of a
gloomy abode below the earth, are here fairly left behind.
So too in the first book of the <i>Tusculans</i>, written after the
death of his beloved daughter, Cicero would persuade himself
and others that death cannot be an evil if we once allow
the soul to be immortal: for from its very nature it must
rise into aethereal realms, cannot sink like the body into
the earth.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">820</a> Into its experiences in the aether I do not
need to go here. Enough has been said to show that, as
it were, the heavens were opened, and with the psychological
separation of soul from body the imaginative
faculty was released also; not indeed that any Roman,
or even Posidonius himself, could revel in cosmological
dreams as did Plato, but they found in him all they
needed, and it would seem that they made much use of
it. Plato's <i>Timaeus</i> was made by Posidonius the subject
of a commentary,<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">821</a> and by Cicero himself it was in part
at least translated, about the time when he was writing
the <i>Tusculans</i>, and still deeply moved by his recent loss.
Of this translation a fragment survives; and in the introductory
sentences he indicates a second stimulus to his
Pythagorean tendencies, besides Posidonius. He tells how
he had met at Ephesus, when on his way to his province
of Cilicia, the famous Pythagorean Nigidius Figulus, and
had enjoyed conversation with him.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">822</a> Nigidius was an
old friend, who had helped Cicero in his consulship; he
was one of those "polyhistores" who are characteristic of
the age, like Posidonius and Varro, and wrote works on
all kinds of subjects of which but few fragments remain.
But his reputation as a Pythagorean survived for centuries;<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">823</a>
and this mention of him by Cicero is only
another proof of the direction the thoughts of the latter
were taking in these last two years of his life.</p>

<p>Clearly, then, Cicero in his philosophical writings of
these years was affected by the current of mysticism that
was then running. But to me it is still more interesting
to find it moving him in a practical matter of which he
has himself left the truth on record; for Cicero is a real
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>human being for whom all who are familiar with his
letters must have something in the nature of affection,
and with whom, too, we feel genuine sympathy in the
calamity which now fell upon him. It was early in
45 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> that he lost his only and dearly loved daughter,
and the blow to his sensitive temperament, already hardly
tried by political anxiety, was severe. We still have the
private letters which he wrote to Atticus after her death
from his solitude at Astura on the edge of the melancholy
Pomptine marshes;<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">824</a> and here, if our minds are sufficiently
divested of modern ideas and trained to look on
death with Roman eyes, we may be startled to find him
thinking of her as still in some sense surviving, and as
divine rather than human: as a deity or spirit to whom a
<i>fanum</i> could be erected. He makes it clear to Atticus,
who is acting as his business agent at Rome, that he does
not want a mere tomb (<i>sepulcrum</i>), but a <i>fanum</i>, which as
we have seen was the general word for a spot of ground
sacred to a deity. "I wish to have a <i>fanum</i> built, and
that wish cannot be rooted out of my heart. I am
anxious to avoid any likeness to a tomb, not so much on
account of the penalty of the law, as in order to attain as
nearly as possible to an <i>apotheosis</i>. This I could do if I
built it in the villa itself, but ... I dread the changes of
owners. Wherever I construct it on the land, I think
that I could secure that posterity should respect its
sanctity."<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">825</a> The word here translated sanctity is <i>religio</i>;
we may remember that all burial places were <i>loca religiosa</i>,
not consecrated by the State, yet hallowed by the feeling
of awe or scruple in approaching them; but Cicero is
probably here using the word rather in that wider sense
in which it so often expresses the presence of a deity in
some particular spot.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">826</a></p>

<p>Atticus was a man of the world and probably an
Epicurean, and his friend in two successive letters half
apologises for this strong desire. "I should not like it to
be known by any other name but <i>fanum</i>,&mdash;unreasonably,
you will perhaps say." And again, "you must bear with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>these silly wishes (<i>inepti&aelig;</i>) of mine."<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">827</a> But this only makes
the intensity of his feeling about it the more plain and
significant; he really seems to want Tullia to be thought
of as having passed into the sphere of divinity, however
vaguely he may have conceived of it. Perhaps he remembered
his own words in Scipio's dream, "Deum te esse
scito." The ashes of Tullia rested in the family tomb,
but the godlike thing imprisoned in her mortal body was
to be honoured at this <i>fanum</i>, which, strange as it may
seem to us, her father wished to erect in a public and
frequented place. She does not fade away into the common
herd of Manes, but remains, though as a spirit, the
same individual Tullia whom her father had loved so dearly.</p>

<p>I long ago explained the old Roman idea of Manes,<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">828</a>
a vague conception of shades of the dead dwelling below
the earth, and hardly, if at all, individualised. But in
Tullia's case we meet with a clear conception of an
individual spirit; and this alone would lead us to suspect
a Pythagorean influence at work, such as that under
which Virgil wrote the famous words "Quisque suos
patimur Manes," which simply mean "Each individual of
us must endure his own individual ghosthood."<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">829</a> This
process of individualisation must have been gradually
coming on, but the steps are lost to us; we only know
that the earliest sepulchral inscription which speaks to it,
in the vague plural Di Manes so familiar in later times, is
dateable somewhere about this very time.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">830</a> My friend
Dr. J. B. Carter would explain it, in part at least, by the
Roman conception of Genius to which I alluded just now,
and doubtless this must be taken into account. For
myself I would rather think of it as the natural result of
the growth of individualism in the living human being
during the last two centuries <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Surely it was impossible
for personality to grow as it did in that period without
a corresponding growth of the idea of individual
immortality in the minds of all who believed in a future
life of any kind at all. The Epicureans did not so
believe; but Roman Stoics instructed by Panaetius and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>Posidonius might not only believe in immortality but in an
immortality of the individual.</p>

<p>Let me take this opportunity of noting that there was, of
course, no sort of restriction on a man's belief about this
or any other religious question. It was perfectly open to
every one to hold what view best pleased him about the
state of the dead: all that the State required of him was that
he should fulfil his obligations at the tombs of his own kin.
No dogma reigned in the necropolis, only duty, <i>pietas</i>,&mdash;and
that <i>pietas</i> implied no conviction. The Parentalia in
February were originally, so far as we can discern, only a
yearly renewal of the rite of burial on its anniversary;<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">831</a>
this implies civilisation and some kind of calendar, but
not a creed. Later on, in the Fasti of the City-state, the
day was fixed for all citizens without regard of anniversaries;
and here the rites become a matter of <i>ius</i>, the <i>ius
Manium</i>, to the observance of which the Manes are
entitled. Still there is no creed, though Cicero speaks of
this <i>ius</i> as based on the idea of a future life.<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">832</a> As a fact
these rites are a survival from an age in which the dead
man was believed to go on living in the grave, but that
primitive idea was no longer held by the educated. Each
man was free in all periods to believe what he pleased
about the dead, and as the Romans began to think, this
freedom becomes easy to illustrate. Cicero himself is
usually agnostic, as is in keeping with his Academic
tendency in philosophy; even in one of these very letters
he seems to speak of his own non-existence after death.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">833</a>
So, too, the excellent Servius Sulpicius, in the famous
letter of condolence written to Cicero at this time from
Athens, seems to be uncertain.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">834</a> We all know the words
of Caesar (reported by Sallust), which are often quoted
with a kind of holy horror, as though a pontifex maximus
might not hold any opinion he pleased about death, and
as though his doubt were not the common doubt of
innumerable thinking men of the age.<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">835</a> Catullus wrote
of death as "nox perpetua dormienda"; Lucretius, of
course, gloried in the thought that there is no life beyond.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>In the following century the learned Pliny could write of
death as the relapsing into the same nothingness as before
we were born, and could scoff at the absurdities of the
cult of the dead.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">836</a></p>

<p>But when a man like Cicero was deeply touched by
grief, his emotional nature abandoned its neutral attitude,
and turned for consolation to mysticism. As I have said,
he was persuading himself that Tullia was still living,&mdash;a
glorified spirit. We can gain just a momentary glimpse
of what was in his mind by turning to the fragments of
the <i>Consolatio</i> which he was now writing at Astura.</p>

<p>This was a <i>Consolatio</i> of the kind which was a recognised
literary form of this and later times,<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">837</a> though in
this case it was addressed by the writer to himself; to
write was for Cicero second nature, and he was sure to take
up his pen when he had feelings that needed expression. It
is unfortunately lost, all but one fragment, which he quotes
himself in the first book of his <i>Tusculans</i>, and one or two
more preserved by the Christian writer Lactantius, a great
admirer of Cicero, who came near to catching the beauty
of his style. The passage quoted by himself is precious.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">838</a>
It insists on the spiritual nature of the soul, which can
have nothing in common with earth or matter of any
kind, seeing that it thinks, remembers, foresees: "ita
quicquid est illud, quod sentit, quod sapit, quod vivit,
quod viget, caeleste et divinum, ob eamque rem aeternum
sit necesse est." And in the concluding words he hints
strongly at the <i>divinity</i> of the soul, which is of the same
make as God himself,&mdash;of the same immaterial nature
as the only Deity of whom we mortals can conceive.
His daughter, therefore, is not only still living in a
spiritual life, but she is in some vague sense divine; that
word <i>apotheosis</i>, which he twice uses in the letters, has a
real meaning for him at this moment; and in a fragment
of the <i>Consolatio</i> quoted by Lactantius he makes this
quite plain; "Te omnium optimam doctissimamque,
approbantibus dis immortalibus ipsis, in eorum co&euml;tu
locatam, ad opinionem omnium mortalium consecrabo."<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">839</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>Undoubtedly Cicero is here under the influence of the
Pythagoreans as well as of his own emotion. In another
chapter Lactantius seems to make this certain;<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">840</a> he
begins by combining Stoics and Pythagoreans as both
believing the immortality of the soul, goes on to deal with
the Pythagorean doctrine (or one form of it) that in this
life we are expiating the sins of another, and ends by
quoting Cicero's <i>Consolatio</i> to that effect: "Quid Ciceroni
faciemus? qui cum in principio Consolationis suae dixit,
luendorum scelerum causa nasci homines, iteravit id ipsum
postea, quasi obiurgans eum qui vitam poenam non esse
putet." Another lost book, the <i>Hortensius</i>, which was
written immediately after the <i>Consolatio</i>, March to May
45,<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">841</a> shows in one or two surviving fragments exactly the
same tendency of thought and reading.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">842</a> Our conclusion
then must be that Cicero, always impressionable, and in
his way also religious, had in this year 45 a real religious
experience. He was brought face to face with one of the
mysterious facts of life, and with one of the great mysteries
of the universe, and the religious instinct awoke within him.
How many others, even in that sordid and materialistic
age, may have had the like experience, with or without a
mystical philosophy to guide their thoughts? In the last
words of the famous Laudatio Turiae, of which I have
written at length in my <i>Social Life in the Age of Cicero</i>,<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">843</a>
we may perhaps catch an echo of a similar religious
feeling: "Te di Manes tui ut quietam patiantur atque
ita tueantur opto" (I pray that thy divine Manes may
keep thee in peace and watch over thee). These words,
expressing the hope of a practical man, not of a philosopher,
are very difficult to explain, except as the
unauthorised utterances of an individual. They hardly
find a parallel either in literature or inscriptions. We
must not press them, yet they help us to divine that there
was in this last half-century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> some mystical yearning
to realise the condition of the loved ones gone before, and
the relation of their life to that of the living. This
religious instinct, let us note once for all, is not identical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>with the old one which we expressed by the formula
about the Power manifesting itself in the universe. The
religious instinct of the primitive Roman was concerned
only with this life and its perils and mysteries; the
religious instinct of Cicero's time was not that of simple
men struggling with agricultural perils, but that of
educated men whose minds could pass in emotional
moments far beyond the troubles of this present world, to
speculate on the great questions, why we are here, what
we are, and what becomes of us after death.</p>

<p>But what of the ordinary Roman of this age&mdash;what
of the man who was not trained to think, and had no
leisure or desire to read? What did he believe about
a future life, or did he believe anything? This brings
us to a curious question about which I must say a very
few words&mdash;did this ordinary Roman, as Lucretius seems
to insist, believe in Hades and its torments? Not in
one passage only does Lucretius insist on this. "That
fear of Hell" (so Dr. Masson translates him) "must be
driven out headlong, which troubles the life of man from
its inmost depth, and overspreads everything with the
blackness of death, and permits no pleasure to be pure
and unalloyed."<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">844</a> I need not multiply quotations;
evidently the poet believed what he said, though he
may be using the exaggeration of poetical diction. And
to a certain extent he is borne out by the literature of
his time. In fact Polybius, writing nearly a century
earlier of the Romans and their religion, implies that
such notions were common, and that they were invented
by "the ancients" to frighten the people into submission.<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">845</a>
Cicero, though he of course thinks of them as merely
the fables of poets, seems to suggest that the ordinary
man did believe in them; thinking of his own recent
loss, he says that our misery would be unbearable when
we lose those we love, if we really thought of them as
"<i>in iis malis quibus vulgo opinantur</i>."<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">846</a> Of course all
these fables were Greek, not Roman. There is no reason
to believe that the old Romans imagined their own dead
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>experiencing any miseries in Orcus&mdash;the old name, as
it would seem, for the dimly imagined abode of the
Manes, afterwards personified after the manner of Plutus.<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">847</a>
No doubt they believed that the dead were ghosts,
desiring to get back to their old homes, who, in the
well-ordered religion of the City-state, were limited in
this strong desire to certain days in the civic year.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">848</a> But
their first acquaintance with Hades and its tortures may
probably be dated early, <i>i.e.</i> when they first became
acquainted with Etruscan works of art, themselves the
result of a knowledge of Greek art and myth.<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">849</a> Early
in the second century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Plautus in the <i>Captivi</i> alluded
to these paintings as familiar;<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">850</a> and we must not forget
that the Etruscans habitually chose the most gruesome
and cruel of the Greek fables for illustration, and
especially delighted in that of Charon, one likely enough
to strike the popular imagination. The play-writers
themselves were responsible for inculcating the belief, as
Boissier remarked in his work on the Roman religion of
the early empire.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">851</a> In the theatre, with women and
children present, Cicero says in the first book of his
<i>Tusculans</i>, the crowded auditorium is moved as it listens
to such a "grande carmen" as that sung by a ghost
describing his terrible journey from the realms of
Acheron; and in another passage of the same book
he mentions both painters and poets as responsible for
a delusion which philosophers have to refute.<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">852</a> I need
not say that the Roman poets too continually use the
imagery of Tartarus; but they use it as literary tradition,
and in the sixth <i>Aeneid</i> it is used also to enforce the
idea of duty to the State which is the real theme of
the poem.</p>

<p>As Dr. Masson truly observes, we have the literature
but we have not the folklore of the age of Cicero and
Virgil; and it must be confessed that without the folklore
such scanty literary evidence as I have just mentioned
does not come to much. Dr. Masson indeed
concludes on this evidence that the fear of future torments
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>played a considerable part in the religious notions both
of the common people and possibly of some of the educated.
I think it may have been so, but on other grounds,
which I must briefly explain.</p>

<p>From all that I have said in these lectures about the
religious ideas represented in the earliest calendar, <i>i.e.</i>
those of the governing Romans of the earliest City-state,
it will be plain that a gruesome eschatology was an impossibility
for them. Just the same may be said of the
Greek ideas represented in the Homeric poems; for with
the exception of the Nekuia of the <i>Odyssey</i>, which almost
all scholars agree in attributing to a later age than the
bulk of the two Homeric epics, in this poetry <i>il se fait
grand jour</i>.<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">853</a> This is not the first time that I have
compared the religion of the Roman patricians to that of
Homer;<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">854</a> and there is a growing conviction among
experts that we have in each case the ideas of a comparatively
civilised immigrant population, whose religion,
though it has developed in very different ways, has the
common characteristic of cleanness and brightness. In
Italy it is practical, in Homer imaginative; but in both
it is free from the brutal and the grotesque. Even the
eschatology of the eleventh <i>Odyssey</i> is not cruel, it is
comparatively colourless; and, as I said just now, this
also may be said of the Roman ideas of Orcus and the
Manes.</p>

<p>In each case it is life, not death, that is of interest to
the living; death is rather a negation than anything
distinctly realised. The state of the dead in Homer is
shadowy and <i>triste</i>, a state not to be desired, as Achilles
so painfully expresses it in a famous passage; but the
<i>life</i> of the Achaean in the poems is vivid&mdash;nay, such
a vivid realisation of life can alone account for the
production of such poems. So, too, the immigrant
population at Rome, to whom is due the regulation of
the religion as we know it, and the inspiring force that
made for ordered government and warlike enterprise,
was too full of practical if not of imaginative vitality to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>be apt to dwell upon the possibilities of existence after
death, to conceive of such existence as either happy or
miserable, the reward or the punishment for things done
in this world.</p>

<p>But in each peninsula this immigrant race was living
in the midst of a far more primitive population; and it
is perhaps to this population that we must look for the
origin of the more detailed and imaginative notions of
the life of the dead. Of the Greeks in this matter I
have not space here to speak, nor am I competent to do
so. But the conviction is steadily gaining ground that
in early Rome we have to recognise the existence of two
races; whether the older of these was Ligurian, as Prof.
Ridgeway thinks, or primitive Latin, <i>i.e.</i> old Italic, as
Binder believes, does not matter for our present purpose;<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">855</a>
nor are the arguments drawn from religion which these
writers have used at all convincing to my intelligence.
But they have not noticed what is to me a really valid
argument, viz. the double festival of the dead in the
calendar of Numa. In February we find the cheerful
and orderly festival of the Parentalia, the yearly renewal
of the seemly rite of burial; in May, on the other hand,
the student of the calendar is astonished to find three
several days called Lemuria, the rites belonging to which
are never mentioned, except where Ovid treats us to a
grotesque account of the driving out of ancestral spirits
from the house.<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">856</a> No one doubts, I think, that the
Lemuria represents an older stratum of thought about
the dead than the other festival,<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">857</a> but no one, so far as I
know, has ventured to claim the Lemures and their three
days as belonging to the religion of the more primitive
race. If I make this suggestion now, it must be taken
as a hypothesis only, but as a hypothesis it can at least
do no harm. If I am asked why Lemuria should have
been admitted into the patrician calendar, I answer that
I have long held that a few of the non-patrician religious
customs were absorbed into the religion of the city of
the four regions, the Lupercalia, for example;<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">858</a> and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>nothing could be more likely than that the old barbarous
ideas about the dead should win this amount of respect,
seeing that by the limitation to three days in the year
order and decency might be brought into their service.
I may repeat, with a slight addition, what I wrote ten
years ago about these two Roman festivals of the dead:
"If we compare Ovid's account of the grotesque domestic
rites of the Lemuria with those of February, which were
of a systematic, cheerful, and even beautiful character, we
may feel fairly sure that the latter represent the organised
life of a City-state, the former the ideas of an age when
life was wilder and less secure, and the fear of the dead,
of ghosts and demons, was a powerful factor in the minds
of the people. If we may argue from Ovid's account, it
is not impossible that the Lemuria may have been one of
those periodical expulsions of demons of which we hear
so much in the <i>Golden Bough</i>, and which are performed
on behalf of the community as well as in the domestic
circle among savage peoples. It is noticeable that the
offering of food to the demons is a feature common to
these practices, and that it also appears in those described
by Ovid."<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">859</a> To this I should now add the suggestion
above made, that the Lemuria represents the ideas of
the older race that occupied the site of Rome, while
the Parentalia is originally the festival of the patrician
immigrants.</p>

<p>But what has all this to do with the eschatology which
Lucretius attributes to the common people at Rome in his
own day? Simply this, that the ideas at the root of the
Lemuria may well have provided the raw material for
such an eschatology, while those at the root of the
Parentalia could not have done this. Dr. Westermarck
has recently shown that primitive religions do spontaneously
generate the idea of moral retribution after
death, <i>e.g.</i> the notion that the souls of bad people may
reappear as evil spirits or obnoxious animals.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">860</a> We have
no proof whatever of the existence of such notions at
Rome; but I contend that the permanence of this type
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>of belief about the dead which is represented by the
Lemuria&mdash;a permanence which is attested by Ovid's
description&mdash;raises a presumption that the lower stratum
of the Roman population, if the chance were given it,
would the more readily understand the pictures of
Etruscan artists and the allusions of Greek playwrights,
and the more easily become the prey of the eschatological
horrors which Lucretius describes as terrifying them. The
material was there from the earliest times, and all that
was needed was for Greeks and Etruscans to work
upon it.</p>

<p>Before leaving this point it may be worth while to
remember that though the well-to-do and educated classes
cremated their dead, the poor of the crowded city population
of the period I am now dealing with enjoyed no such
orderly and cleanly funeral rites. The literary evidence
is explicit on this point, and has been confirmed by
modern excavation on the Esquiline, where we know from
Varro and Horace that the poor and the slaves were
thrown <i>en masse</i> into <i>puticuli</i>, <i>i.e.</i> holes where it was
impossible that any memorial ceremonies could be kept
up.<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">861</a> Horace's lines are familiar (<i>Sat.</i> 8. 8):</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">huc prius angustis eiecta cadavera cellis</span>
<span class="i0">conservus vili portanda locabat in arca.</span>
<span class="i0">hoc miserae plebi stabat commune sepulcrum, etc.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is dangerous to be too confident about the effect on
the religious imagination of different ways of dealing
with the dead; but it is at least not improbable that
any inherited tendency to believe in a miserable future
for the soul would be confirmed and maintained by so
miserable a fate for the body. The mass of the population
had little chance of ridding itself of eschatological
superstition.</p>

<p>Thus I am inclined to come to Dr. Masson's conclusion,
though on somewhat different grounds. I think
it quite possible that the uneducated in the age of the
poet may have really been inoculated with these ideas of
cruel retribution, and that in many cases this may have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>resulted in despair or at least discomfort. Only we must
remember that in a great city like Rome, as in Paris or
London to-day, both the miseries and the enjoyments of
life would tend to accustom the minds of the lower strata
to consider the present rather than the future; the
necessities and pleasures of the moment are with them
the only material of thought. Neither comfort nor remonstrance
could reach them from pulpit or from missioner;
neither fear nor hope could largely enter into their lives.
In fact I half suspect that most of them were, after all,
so long as they were healthy and active, much what
Lucretius would have them be&mdash;free from all religious
scruple; but, alas, utterly destitute of the intellectual
support which he claimed from the study of philosophy.
We can well understand how it was among the lower
population of the great cities that early Christianity found
its chance. They had no education or philosophy to
stand between them and the gospel of redemption.</p>

<p>I must say one word about another kind of transcendentalism
which was pushing its way into favour in
Roman society at this time&mdash;I mean astrology. One
may call it transcendental because it was based, in its
original home in the East, on a mystical notion of
sympathy between the phenomena of the starry heavens
and the phenomena of human life;<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">862</a> and that this
notion was carefully inculcated by those who taught the
"science" at Rome is shown by the long and wearisome
poem on astrology written by Manilius in the succeeding
age. But it is not likely that this form of mysticism
had become really popular before the period of the
Empire, and in any case it can hardly be called a part of
Roman religious experience. I only mention it here as
helping to illustrate the way in which men's minds were
now beginning to turn with interest to speculations
altogether beyond the range of that practical ethical
philosophy which was natural and congenial to the
Roman, altogether beyond the horizon of man's daily
prospect in this world. The growing interest in Fortuna,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>both as natural force and deity, which became intense
under the Empire, is another indication of the same
tendency.<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">863</a></p>

<p>As soon as Rome had come into close contact with
Greece, which had long before been overrun by the
eastern astrology&mdash;by the Chaldaeans or <i>mathematici</i>, as
they are so often called&mdash;these experts began to appear
also in Italy. We first hear of them from old Cato, who
advises that the steward of an estate should be strictly
forbidden to consult <i>Chaldaei</i>, <i>harioli</i>, <i>haruspices</i>, and such
gentry.<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">864</a> In 139 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>&mdash;a year in which there happened
to be in Rome an embassy from Simon Maccabaeus&mdash;Chaldaeans
were ordered to leave Rome and Italy within
ten days; but I think there is some evidence that these
were really Jews who were trying to propagate their own
religion.<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">865</a> For some time we hear nothing more of these
intruders; but they probably gained ground again in the
course of the Mithridatic wars, which were responsible
for the introduction of much Oriental religion into Italy.
They are mentioned in 87, together with &#952;&#8166;&#964;&#945;&#953; and
Sibyllistae, as persuading the ill-fated Octavius to remain
in Rome to meet his death, as it turned out, at the hands
of the Marians.<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">866</a> But no Roman seems to have taken
up astrology as a quasi-scientific study till that Nigidius,
of whom I have already said a word, was persuaded thus
to waste his time and brains. He is said to have foretold
the greatness of Augustus at his birth in 63 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>;<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">867</a> and
from this time forward the taking of horoscopes or <i>genethliaca</i>
became a favourite pursuit at Rome&mdash;unfortunately
for the people of Europe, who caught the infection
and kept it endemic for at least fifteen centuries.</p>

<p>Astrology is in no sense religion, and I must leave it
with these few remarks. It represents the individual and
his personal interests, not even the advantage of the community,
and it was for this reason that the Chaldaei were
disliked by the Roman government. The individual is
not satisfied with legitimate Roman means of divination;
he is employing illegitimate ways when he entrusts himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>to these Orientals, who, most of them doubtless, well
deserved the scathing contempt which Tacitus has contrived
to put into six words: "Genus hominum potentibus
infidum, sperantibus fallax," adding, with no less contempt
for the Roman authorities who had to deal with
them, that they will always be forbidden, and always will
be found at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">868</a></p>

confirming me, to some extent at least, in the conjecture I had here
hazarded. The working of the imagination in regard to a future
state is in Greece, in his view, peculiar to the older or Pelasgic
population; and if the Etruscans were of Pelasgic stock, as is now
believed by many, their imaginative grotesqueness, a degraded form
perhaps of the original characteristic, acting on the ideas of a still
more primitive population of which the Lemuria is a survival, might
explain the later prevalence of a gruesome eschatology at Rome.
But whoever studies Mr. Lawson's chapters closely will find serious
difficulties in the way even of such a hypothesis as this.</p></div>

<h4>LECTURE XVIII</h4>

<h5>RELIGIOUS FEELING IN THE POEMS OF VIRGIL</h5>


<p>My justification for devoting a whole lecture to Virgil
must be that this great poet, more warmly and sympathetically
than any other Latin author, gives expression
to the best religious feeling of the Roman mind. And
this is so not only in regard to the tendencies of religion
in his own day; he stands apart from all his literary
contemporaries in that he sums up the past of Roman
religious experience, reflects that of his own time, and
also looks forward into the future. No other poet, no
historian, not even Livy, who sprang from the same
region and in his tone and spirit in some ways resembles
Virgil, has the same broad outlook, the same tender interest
in religious antiquity, the same all-embracing sympathy
for the Roman world he knew, and the same confident
and cheerful hope for its future. Each of the Augustan
poets&mdash;Horace, Ovid, Propertius, Tibullus&mdash;has his own
peculiar gift and charm; but those who know Virgil
through and through will at once acknowledge the difference
between these and the man possessed of spiritual
insight. They are helpful in various ways to the student
of Roman religion, and Tibullus especially has a simple
reverence for the old religion which has inspired a few
exquisite descriptions of this aspect of Italian life. But,
if I may use the word, they had no mission; they were
true poets, yet not poets of the prophetic order; they had
not thought deeply and reached conviction, like Lucretius
and Virgil. A few words from the conclusion of an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>Edinburgh professor's admirable work on Virgil will
sufficiently express what I mean. "His religious belief,"
says Sellar, "like his other speculative convictions, was
composite and undefined; yet it embraced what was
purest and most vital in the religions of antiquity, and in
its deepest intuitions it seems to look forward to the belief
which became dominant in Rome four centuries later."<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">869</a>
In fact, Virgil gathers up what was valuable in the past of
Rome and adds to it a new element, a new source of life
and hope. It was this that made it possible for a great
French critic to assert that for those who have read Virgil
there is nothing astonishing in Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">870</a> Let us try
and realise what these writers mean. The Scotsman is
sober and earnest, the Frenchman epigrammatically exaggerating;
but the feeling that underlies both utterances
is a true one.</p>

<p>We have traced the gradual paralysis of the secularised
State religion. We have glanced at the two types of
philosophical thought which took the place of that religion
in the minds of the cultivated section of Roman society,
neither of which could adequately supply the Roman and
Italian mind with an expression of its own natural feeling,
never wholly extinct, of its relation to the Power manifesting
itself in the universe. Stoicism came near to doing
what was needed, by rehabilitating itself on Italian soil
and indulging Roman preconceptions of the divine; but it
could not greatly affect the mass of men, and its appeal was
not to feeling, but to reason. Epicurism, though perhaps
more popular, was in reality more in conflict with what was
best in the Italian nature, and the passionate appeal of
Lucretius to look for comfort to a scientific knowledge of
the <i>rerum natura</i> had no enduring power to cheer. Lastly,
we have examined the tendency of the same age towards
mysticism and Cicero's doubting and embarrassed expression
of it, and we found that this tendency rather illustrates
a sense of something wanting than hopefully satisfies it.
We may well feel ourselves, now we have arrived at the
close of the Republican era, just as the best men of that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>day felt, that there <i>is</i> something wanting. In their minds
this feeling almost amounted to despair; in ours, as we
read the story of the troublous time after the death of
Caesar, it is pity and wonder. There was, in fact, more
than a sense of weariness and discomfort, moral and
material, in the Roman mind of that generation&mdash;there
was also what we may almost call a sense of sin, such a
feeling, though doubtless less real and intense, as that
which their prophets, from time to time, awoke in the
Jewish people, and one not unknown in the history of
Hellas. It was essentially a feeling of neglected duty&mdash;of
neglected duty to the Power and of goodwill wanting
towards men. Lucretius had been unconsciously a
powerful witness to this feeling, but had not found the
remedy. In the early Augustan age it is again expressed
by Horace, by Sallust, and more deeply and truly in the
beautiful preface to Livy's History.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">871</a> Livy there says that
he devoted himself to the early annals of Rome that he
might shut his eyes to the evils of his own time&mdash;"tempora
quibus nec vitia nostra nec remedia pati possumus."</p>

<p>This something wanting was then a feeling, a <i>religio</i>, if
we can venture to use the old word once more in the
sense which I have so often attributed to it. Not an
unreasonable or ungovernable feeling, not a <i>superstitio</i>,
but a feeling of happy dependence on a higher Power,
and a desire to conform to His will in all the relations of
human life. This is the kind of feeling that had always
lain at the root of the Roman <i>pietas</i>, the sense of duty to
family and State, and to the deities who protected them.
In the jarring of factions, the cruelty and bloodshed of
tyrants, and the luxurious self-indulgence of the last two
generations, the voice of <i>pietas</i> had been silenced, the
better instincts of humanity had gone down. We have
to see what was done by our poet to awake that voice
again and to put fresh life into those instincts. Only let
us remember that more permanent good is done in this
world by a beautiful nature giving itself its natural expression,
than by precept or denunciation; and beware of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>attributing to Virgil more direct consciousness of his
mission than he really felt. It is the nature of the man
that is of value to us in our studies, as it was to the
Romans in their despair, a nature ruled by sweet, calm
feeling, full of sympathy and full of hope.</p>

<p>The something wanting in others which we find in
Virgil only, or in him more convincingly felt and more
resonantly expressed, is a kindly and hopeful outlook on
the world, with a deep and real sympathy for all sorrow
and pain. It is not the result of any definite religious
conviction; it is in the nature of the man, and is of the
very fibre of his being; but it made him a better religious
teacher than the rest, just because real religion is not a
matter of reason only, or of convention, or of art, but of
feeling. This was the true antidote to despair or depression&mdash;a
sympathy with man in all he does or suffers, not
an indignant cry of remonstrance like that of Lucretius.
Virgil's sympathetic outlook includes not only Man, but
the animal world, and there can be no better proof that
his feeling was genuine. The nightingale robbed of her

touch, all show us the feeling of which I am speaking; for
he who could so feel towards animals must needs have a
soul of pity for man. So, too, with the inanimate nature
of Italy; the land in which Virgil's shepherds and husbandmen
live and work is one full of such detailed loveliness
as might suggest a beneficent Power presiding over it all,
inviting man to lift up his heart in gratitude or prayer.
As Sellar has well remarked,<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">875</a> the sense of natural beauty
is in the <i>Georgics</i> intertwined with the toil of man, raising,
as it were, the toiler to a higher level of humanity as he
lifts his eyes from his work. And this natural beauty is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>made real for the reader by the life and force that everywhere
pervades it; all nature is alive and full of feeling;
the fruit trees, for example, in the second <i>Georgic</i> seem
instinct with an almost human life.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">876</a> The moment this
comes home to us we see how it harmonises with all we
have learnt of the old Italian conception of the divine, of
the forceful <i>numina</i> working for man's benefit if properly
propitiated. And even when Virgil is using the language
of the Stoics to explain the life of nature, we feel that
behind the philosophical theory there lies this feeling of
the Italian:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">deum namque ire per omnes</span>
<span class="i0">terrasque tractusque maris caelumque profundum:</span>
<span class="i0">hinc pecudes, armenta, viros, genus omne ferarum.<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">877</a></span>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is the religious spirit of the <i>Georgics</i>; the divine
forces are everywhere, and a man must submit himself to
them and seek their aid. He finds his true resource
rather in prayer than in philosophy, his part in the world
is "laborare et orare." The hard lot of the Hesiodic
labourer is not that of the <i>agricola</i> of the <i>Georgics</i>, who
carries on his campaign of toil with a cheerful heart and
a clear conscience, for he is in right relation with the
Power manifesting itself in the life around him.</p>

<p>This, then, so far as I can describe it without going too
far into detail, is the feeling, the <i>religio</i>, which was needed
in the Italy of that day. We may, perhaps, venture to
compare its revival in the work of Virgil with the return
to nature in the English poetry of a century ago, which
also brought with it a revival of religious fervency.
Though Virgil and Wordsworth are in many ways as
unlike as two poets can be, they are alike in the possession
of that gentle and trustful outlook on the world of
nature which stimulates the mind to think of itself in its
relation to the Power. We do not need to analyse the
process or to put it into any logical shape; we may rest
content with it as a fact in the history of Roman religious
experience.</p>

<p>In Virgil's case, as in Wordsworth's, this feeling had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>the effect of reconciling the poet's mind to the old forms
of religious worship. Reconcile is, perhaps, hardly the
right word; we may doubt whether he had ever quarrelled
with them. As he believed in the Power and its
manifestations, so too he believed in the traditional modes
of propitiating it, not asking himself the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of
this or that ceremony, still less looking on them with pity
and contempt, like Lucretius, but accepting them in his
broad humanity as part of the life and thought of man
in Italy.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">fortunatus et ille Deos qui <i>novit</i> agrestes.<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">878</a></span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let us mark the word <i>novit</i>. The husbandman has come
to recognise these emanations of the Power and to know
them as friends; the word could not have been used of
malignant spirits. As I said in an early lecture, man
advances in his knowledge of the Power as he advances
in civilisation. So the rural rites have a claim on his
sympathy no less than the men who performed them; he
knew them in their detail, and he knew them in the spirit
which animated them. He must have studied them in
detail, and not only the rural cults, but those of the city
too; every gesture in worship has an interest for him,
and so great is our respect for his accuracy that we accept
what he tells us even if we cannot explain it.<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">879</a> His
careful learning in all these details has been the means of
preserving for us large sources of knowledge; for Servius,
Macrobius, and other commentators accumulated stores of
it in endeavouring to interpret him.</p>

<p>Now, this is not mere antiquarianism in Virgil, any
more than is the detail of old life which abounds in Scott's
poems and novels. These two men had the same wide,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>sympathetic outlook on the world. Scott was interested
in everything and everybody, whether living or dead long
ago, and in all they did; and I think we may say the
same of Virgil, though he is said to have been rather
reserved and shy than genial and talkative like Scott.
Virgil's mind was not so much "curious," I think, as
sympathetic, and his delight in these religious details
arises from his love of Italy and all that man did in it.
He caught the spirit of the old Italian worship, which, as
we saw, demanded that each act should be performed
accurately according to rules laid down. He recognises
the necessity, and with true Italian instinct he acts upon
it as he writes. He knows that these acts of cult are
one outward expression of that quality which had made
Rome great&mdash;<i>pietas</i>, the sense of duty to family, State,
and Deity.</p>

<p>So far I have been considering what I may call the
psychological basis of Virgil's religion&mdash;the man's sympathetic
nature and wide outlook, which included in its
love of Italy even the old practical worship of Italians. I
have now to go on to the poet's greatest work, in which
the idea of duty was not merely recognised in religious
acts but exemplified in an ideal Roman. It is mainly in
the <i>Aeneid</i> that we see him looking forward as well as
backward, for it is there that we have the chart of the
Roman's duty drawn to the scale of his past history, and
meant to guide him in the future in still more glorious
travel.</p>

<p>There are two ways in which we may contemplate the
<i>Aeneid</i> as a whole and the teaching it offered the Roman
of that day. We may think of it (if I may for a moment
use musical language) as a great fugue, of which the
leading subject is the mission of Rome in the world.
Providence, Divine will, the Reason of the Stoics, or, in
the poetical setting of the poem, Jupiter, the great protecting
Roman deity, with the Fates behind him somewhat
vaguely conceived,<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">880</a> had guided the State to greatness
and empire from its infancy onwards, and the citizens of
that State must be worthy of that destiny if they were to
carry out the great work. This mighty theme pervades
the whole poem and, like the subject of a fugue, enters
and re-enters from time to time in thrilling tones. It is
given out in the prophecy put into the mouth of Jupiter
himself at the beginning of the first book; it is heard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>in still more magnificent music from the shade of old
Anchises in the last moments of the hero's visit to Hades
in the sixth book, and again in the description of the
shield which Venus gives her son.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">881</a> Though the poem
is unequal and some parts of it are left without the final
touches, yet whenever the poet comes upon this great
theme the tone is that of a full organ. This is, I think,
apart from those exquisite beauties of detail which are
for those only who have been initiated in the Virgilian
mysteries, what chiefly moves the modern reader of Virgil.
There are drawbacks which, for us moderns at least,
detract from the general effect: the intervention of gods
and goddesses after the Homeric manner, but without the
charm of Homer; the seeming want of warm human
blood in the hero; the stern decrees of Fate overruling
human passions and interests; but he who keeps the
great theme ever in mind, watching for it as he reads, as
one watches for the new entry of a great fugue-subject,
will never fail to see in the <i>Aeneid</i> one of the noblest
efforts of human art&mdash;to understand what makes it the
world's second great epic.</p>

<p>But this great destiny of Rome has been accomplished
by the service of man; by his loyalty, self-sacrifice, and
sense of duty; by that quality known to the Romans as
<i>pietas</i>; and the second lesson or reminder of the <i>Aeneid</i>
lies in the exemplification of this truth in the person and
character of the hero. We moderns find it hard to
interest ourselves in the character of Aeneas. But as Prof.
Nettleship remarked long ago,<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">882</a> a Roman reader would
not have thought him dull or uninteresting; if that had
been so, the poem could hardly have become popular
from the moment of its publication. I am inclined to
think that the <i>development</i> of the character of Aeneas
under stress of perils, moral and material, was much more
obvious to the Roman than it is to us, and much more
keenly appreciated. For him it was the chief lesson of
the poem, which makes it as it were a "whole duty of the
Roman"; and as this lesson is really a part of Roman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>religious experience I am going to occupy the rest of this
lecture with it.</p>

<p>The development of the character of Aeneas, under
the influence of perils and temptations through which he
is guided by Jupiter and the Fates, is not a subject which
has received much attention from modern criticism.<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">883</a>
Yet to me, at least, it would be surprising if the leading
character of the poem were, so to speak, a statue once
and for all conceived and executed by the artist, instead
of a human being subjected to various experiences which
work upon his character as well as his career. There
were circumstances in Virgil's time which made it natural
that a poet of a serious and philosophical turn of mind
should be interested in the development of character and
make it part of his great subject. We have more than
once had occasion to notice the growth of individualism
in the last two centuries <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Beyond doubt personal
character had a great interest at this time for thinking
men, apart from its development; the world was ruled
by individuals, and at no time has so much depended on
the disposition of individuals. Men had long begun to
take themselves very seriously, and to write their own
biographies. So entirely had the individual emancipated
himself from the State, that he had almost forgotten that
the State existed and claimed his <i>pietas</i>; he worked
and played for his own ends.<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">884</a> Even the armies of that
melancholy age were known and thought of, not as the
servants of the State, but as Sullani, Pompeiani, and so
on. This almost arrogant self-assertion of the individual
was a fact of the time, and could not be suppressed
entirely; it was henceforward impossible to return to the
old times when the State was all in all and the individual
counted for little.</p>

<p>But in the <i>Aeneid</i>, if I am not mistaken, there is
an almost perfect balance between the two conflicting
interests. The State is the pivot on which turns all that
is best in individual human character; in other words,
Aeneas is not playing his own game, but fulfilling the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>order of destiny which was to bring the world under
Roman dominion. Individualism of the wrong type, that
of Dido, Turnus, Mezentius, has to be escaped or overcome
by the hero, for whom the call of duty is that of the
State to be; but, all the same, the hero is an <i>individual</i>,
and one conceived not merely as a type or a force.
True, he is typical of Roman <i>pietas</i>, and bears his constant
epithet accordingly; but if we look at him carefully we
shall see that his <i>pietas</i> is at first imperfect, and that his
individualism has to be tamed and brought into the service
of the State <i>with the help of the State's deities</i>. This
is what makes the <i>Aeneid</i> a religious poem; the character
of Aeneas is pivoted on religion; religion is the one
sanction of his conduct. There is no appeal in the
<i>Aeneid</i> to knowledge, or reason, or pleasure,&mdash;always
to the will of God. <i>Pietas</i> is Virgil's word for religion,
as it had been Cicero's in his more exalted moments.
In the Dream of Scipio we read that "<i>piis</i> omnibus
retinendus est animus in custodia corporis: nec iniussu
eius a quo ille est vobis datus, ex hominum vita migrandum
est, <i>ne munus humanum adsignatum a deo defugisse videamini</i>."<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">885</a>
In these words, as is shown by those that
follow, the <i>munus hominum</i> is exactly what it is in the
<i>Aeneid</i>, duty to Man and the State, and as it is laid
down for man by God, it is also duty to Him. The
State finds its perfection in the individual so long as he
thus fulfills the will of God.<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">886</a></p>

<p>Let us now go on to watch Aeneas as he gradually
develops this perfect balance of motive.</p>

<p>Aeneas is marked at the very outset of the poem as
"insignem pietate virum"; the key-note of his character
is sounded here at once with skill, and the key thus
suggested (to use musical metaphor once more) is maintained
steadily throughout it. The quality demanded by
the gods from every true Roman who would take his
part in carrying out the divine mission of Rome must
be emphasised in the ideal Roman. Yet, as we read on,
we soon discover that Aeneas was by no means as yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>a perfect character. It can hardly be by accident that
the poet has described him as yielding to despair and
bewailing his fate on the first approach of danger&mdash;forgetting
the mission before him and the destiny driving
him on, and wishing that he were lying dead with Hector
under the walls of Troy (i. 92 foll.). It would have been
easy enough for Virgil to have taken up at once the
heroic vein in the man, as it was left him by Homer,<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">887</a>
and to have made him urge his men to bestir themselves
or to yield bravely to fate. And this is precisely what
Aeneas does <i>when the storm is over and the danger past</i>
(198 foll.); yet even then he is not whole-hearted about it:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">talia voce refert, curisque ingentibus aeger</span>
<span class="i0"><i>spem voltu simulat</i>, premit alto corde dolorem.</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the very moment, that is, when he expresses his belief
in his destiny and the duty of making for Italy, he still
has misgivings, though he dare not express them.</p>

<p>Heinze has remarked<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">888</a> that before this, at the sack of
Troy, he had shown a want of self-control, and yielded
to a mad passion of desperate fighting that is not to be
found in the Aeneas of the last six books (ii. 314 foll.):</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">arma amens capio nec sat rationis in armis.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Furor</i> and <i>ira</i> drive him headlong; we are reminded of
the mad fury of Mezentius or Turnus.</p>

<p>Again, after the death of Priam Venus has to remind
him of his duty to his father, wife, and son (ii. 594 foll.),
reproaching him for his loss of sanity and self-control:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">nate, quis indomitas tantus dolor excitat iras?</span>
<span class="i0">quid furis, aut quonam nostri tibi cura recessit?</span>
<span class="i0">non prius aspicies ubi fessum aetate parentem</span>
<span class="i0">liqueris Anchisen, superet coniunxne Creusa</span>
<span class="i0">Ascaniusque puer?<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">889</a></span>
</div>
</div>
<p>During the wanderings narrated in the third book
it is Anchises who leads, and who receives and interprets
the divine warnings; he seems to be the guardian and
guide of his son: to that son he is "omnis curae casusque
levamen" (iii. 709), and he is "felix nati pietate" (iii. 480).
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>He is, in fact, the typical Roman father, who, unlike
Homer's Laertes, maintains his activity and authority to
the end of his life, and to whom even the grown-up son,
himself a father, owes reverence and obedience. As
Boissier has pointed out,<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">890</a> the death of Anchises is postponed
in the story as long as possible, and it is only
after his death that Aeneas is exposed to a really dangerous
temptation; it is immediately after this event that,
as we saw, he loses heart at the first storm, and then, on
landing in Africa, falls a victim for the moment to the
queenly charms of Dido. We may notice that up to this
point his <i>pietas</i> has been a limited one, hardly called
upon for exercise beyond the bounds of family life and
duty; when he is himself at the head, not only of the
family, but, so to speak, of the State, it has to take a
wider range, and to be put to a severe test.</p>

<p>To all that has at different times been written about
Virgil's treatment of the Dido legend I must venture here
to add another word. Heinze has shown<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">891</a> that no certain
origin can be discovered for the form of the story as
Virgil tells it; it may have been Naevius who first took
Aeneas to Sicily, but we do not know whether he or any
successor of his invented the essential point of Virgil's
story,&mdash;the suicide of Dido as a consequence of her
desertion by Aeneas.<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">892</a> In any case the question arises,
why our poet should have deliberately abandoned the
current and popular version, and exposed his hero to such
imminent danger of deserting the path which Jupiter and
the Fates had marked out for him,&mdash;of sacrificing his
great mission to the passion of a magnificent woman, and
to the prospect of illicit ease and unsanctioned dominion.
Heinze is of opinion that Virgil's motive was here a purely
artistic one; he wanted an opportunity to introduce the
pathetic element into his epic. "There was no lack of
models; the latest bloom of Greek poetry had been in
nothing more inventive than in dealing with all the
phenomena of the passion of love,&mdash;its agony, shame,
and despair, and the self-immolation of its victims."<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">893</a> He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>enforces this view with great learning, and all he writes
about it is of value; but I must confess that he has not
convinced me that this was Virgil's chief motive. He
seems to me to leave out of account two important considerations:
first, that though the poet drew freely on
every available source, Greek and Roman, for the enrichment
of his subject and its treatment, yet the whole
design and purpose of the <i>Aeneid</i> is Roman and not
Greek, and the introduction of a love-story <i>as such</i> would
have been foreign to that design, and also to the aims
and hopes of Augustus and the best men of the age.
Secondly, Heinze seems to forget, like so many others
who have written about the Dido episode, that Virgil had
before his very eyes facts sufficiently striking, a romance
quite sufficiently appalling, to suggest the adoption of
the form of the story as we have it in the fourth book.
Twice in his own lifetime did a single formidable woman
work a baleful spell upon the destinies of the Roman
empire. In neither case did the spell take fatal effect;
Julius escaped in time from the wiles and the splendour
of Cleopatra; Antony failed indeed to escape, but brought
himself and her to fortunate ruin. It is to me inexplicable,
considering how all Virgil's poems abound with
allusions to the events of his time, and with side-glances
at the chief agents in them, that neither Heinze nor
Norden should have even touched on the possibility that
Cleopatra was in the poet's mind when he wrote the
fourth book. It is perhaps difficult for one who puts the
poem on the dissecting-board, and whose attention is
continually absorbed in the investigation of minute points
in the fibre of it, to bear in mind the extraordinary events
of the poet's lifetime,&mdash;the civil war, the murder of Julius,
the division of the Roman world, the distraction of Italy,
the attempt of Antony, or rather, indeed, of his enslaver,
to set up a rival Oriental dominion, and the rescue of
Romanism and civilisation by Augustus. Had Lucretius
himself lived in that generation, he could hardly have
escaped the influence of these appalling facts. Whoever
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>will turn to the late Prof. Nettleship's essay on the poetry
of Virgil, appended to his <i>Ancient Roman Lives of
Virgil</i>,<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">894</a> can hardly fail to be convinced that on the
later poet's mind they had produced a profound impression,
the effects of which are traceable throughout the whole
mass of his work. His Roman readers, whose state and
empire had been brought to the verge of ruin by the
exaltation of individual passions and ambitions, would
look for these constant allusions and understand them far
better than we can.</p>

<p>I maintain, then, that the poet adopted his version of
the story of Dido not simply as an affecting and pathetic
episode, but (in keeping with his whole design) to
emphasise the great lesson of the poem by showing
that the growth and glory of the Roman dominion are
due, under providence, to Roman <i>virtus</i> and <i>pietas</i>&mdash;that
sense of duty to family, State, and gods, which
rises, in spite of trial and danger, superior to the enticements
of individual passion and selfish ease. Aeneas
is sorely tried, but he escapes from Dido to perform
the will of the gods; it is Jupiter, ruler of the Fates
and the Roman destinies, who rescues him, and thus
the divine care for Rome, an idea of which Augustus
wished to make the most, is carefully preserved in the
tale. If for us the character of Aeneas suffers by his
desertion of Dido, that is simply because the poet,
seized with intense pity for the injured queen, seems
for once, like his own hero, to have forgotten his mission
in the poem, and at the very moment when he means
to show Aeneas performing the noblest act of self-sacrifice,
renouncing his individual passion and listening
to the stern call of duty, human nature gets the better
of him, and what he meant to paint as a noble act has
come out on his canvas as a mean one.</p>

<p>In Virgil's story, then, we have in contrast and conflict
the opposing principles of duty and pleasure, of patriotism
and selfishness, and the victory of the latter in the person
of Aeneas by the help of the great god who was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>guardian of the destinies of Rome, and of the goddess
who was the mother of the hero and the reputed
progenitor of the Julian family. When once this great
trial is over, the way is clear for the accomplishment
of Aeneas' mission, though he still has trials to face,
and as yet is not fully equipped for meeting them.</p>

<p>Whoever, after reading the stormy scenes of the fourth
book, will go straight on to the fifth, cannot but be struck
with a change of tone which would have been doubly
welcome to a man of that true Roman feeling which
Virgil was counting on as well as inculcating throughout
his work&mdash;doubly welcome, because he would
find it not only in the incidents, but in the character of
Aeneas. We here leave self and passion behind, and
are introduced to scenes where the careful performance
of religious and family duties seems to produce ease
of mind and the tranquillity that comes of a soothed
conscience. For the first time in the poem we meet
with a characteristic of that best Roman life which was
dear to the heart of Augustus, and with which we may
be quite certain that the poet himself was entirely in
sympathy. Strange, indeed, it is that this should be the
case in a book so wholly based for its externals on Greek
poetical traditions; but it is none the less true, and it
is a striking example of Virgil's wonderful genius for
transforming old things with new light and meaning.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">895</a></p>

<p>It is not only then, or even mainly, the traditional
necessity of describing games in an epic poem, that is the
<i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of the fifth book; the object was rather, as I
understand it, to gain the needful contrast to the stormy
passion of the fourth, and a relief for the mind of the
Roman reader before he approached the awful scenery and
experiences of the sixth, while at the same time there
could be indicated&mdash;and for a Roman reader more than
indicated&mdash;the <i>first beginning of a change</i> in the character
of the hero. All this is effected with wonderful skill by
making Aeneas perform with detailed carefulness the
Roman ritual of the <i>Parentalia</i> as it was known to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>Romans of the Augustan age. The <i>Parentalia</i>, as I have
said elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">896</a> were not days of terror or ill-omen, but
rather days on which the performance of duty was the
leading idea in men's minds; that duty was a pleasant
and cheerful one, for the dead were still members of the
family, and there was nothing to fear from them so long
as the living performed their duties towards them under
the due regulations of the <i>ius divinum</i>. The ritual
indicates the idea of the yearly renewal of the rite of
burial, with the propitiation of the departed which was
necessary for the welfare of the family; and when the
liturgical nine days were over, the living members met
together in the <i>Caristia</i>, a kind of love feast of the family,
at which all quarrels were to be forgotten, and from which
all guilty members were excluded. In families of wealth
and distinction in Virgil's time the days of mourning
might be followed by <i>games in honour of the departed</i>.
Thus a Roman would at once recognise the fact that
Aeneas is here presented to us for the first time as a Roman
father of a family, discharging the duties essential to the
continuance and prosperity of that family with cheerfulness
as well as with <i>gravitas</i>; and that his <i>pietas</i> here
takes a definite, practical, and truly Roman form, though
it is not as yet extended to its full connotation as the
performance of duty towards the State and its gods.</p>

<p>All this is quite in keeping with the little touches of
characterisation which we can also notice in this book.
In the second line Aeneas pursues his way <i>certus</i>, even
while he gazes at the flames of Dido's funeral pyre, not
knowing what they meant. He presides at the games
with the dignity of a Roman magistrate, and reproachingly
consoles the beaten Dares with words which seem to
reflect his late experience at Carthage (v. 465):</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">infelix, quae tanta animum dementia cepit?</span>
<span class="i0">non vires alias conversaque numina sentis?</span>
<span class="i0"><i>cede deo</i>.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the ships are burnt he does not give way to
despair, as in the storm of the first book, but prays for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>help to the omnipotent Jupiter, in whose hand were the
destinies of his descendants (v. 687 foll.). But he is not
yet perfect in his sense of duty; he feels the blow
severely, and for a moment wavers (v. 700 foll.):</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i7_5">... casu concussus acerbo</span>
<span class="i0">nunc huc ingentis, nunc illuc pectore curas</span>

<span class="i0">oblitus fatorum, Italasne capesseret oras.</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>It needs the cheering advice of old Nautes (<i>quicquid
erit, superanda omnis fortuna ferendo est</i>), and the appearance
of the shade of Anchises, to confirm his wavering
will with renewed sense of his mission. This appearance
of his father, "omnis curae casusque levamen," with the
summons to meet him in Hades, is, as Heinze has seen,<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">897</a>
a turning-point in the fortunes and the character of
Aeneas, and prepares us for the final ordeal and initiation
which he undergoes in the following book.</p>

<p>I here use the word initiation because I have no doubt
that Virgil had in his mind when writing it the Greek
idea of initiation into mysteries preparatory to a new
life. An actual initiation was, of course, out of the
question; on the other hand a <i>catabasis</i>, a descent into
Hades, was part of the epic inheritance he derived from
Homer, and this, like the funeral games in the fifth book,
he might use with an earnestness of purpose wanting in
Homer, to work in with the great theme of his poem,
not merely as an artistic effort. The purpose here was
to make of Aeneas a new man, to regenerate him; to
prepare him by mystic enlightenment for the toil, peril,
and triumph that await him in the accomplishment of
his divine mission. We must not look too closely into
the process; it is a strange m&eacute;lange of popular and
philosophic ideas and scenery, made at once intelligible
and magnificent by the wonderful resources of the poet;
but we may be sure that it has the same general meaning
as the visions of Dante long afterwards. As Mr. Tozer
has said, Dante's conversion and ultimate salvation were
the primary object of his journey through the three realms
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>of the spiritual world.<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">898</a> In this sense it can be called an
initiation, an ordeal, a sacrament.</p>

<p>So much has been written about this wonderful book
that I do not need to dwell upon it here. I will content
myself with pointing out very briefly a fact which struck
me when I last read it. The ordeal of preparation is not
complete till the very end of the book, when the shade of
Anchises has shown his son all the great things to come,
the due accomplishment of which depends on his sense of
duty, his <i>pietas</i>. Up to that moment Aeneas is always
thinking and speaking of the past, while in the last six
books he is always looking ahead, absorbed in the work
each hour placed before him, and in the prospect of the
glory of Rome and Italy. The poet had contrived that
his hero should himself narrate the story of the sack of
Troy and his subsequent wanderings, and narrate them to
the very person who would have made it impossible for
him ever again to look forward on the path of duty.
Surely this is significant of a moral as well as an artistic
purpose; the passionate love of the queen urges her to
keep his mind fixed on the past, to engage him in the
story of events that concerned himself and not his
mission (i. 748):</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">necnon et vario noctem sermone trahebat</span>
<span class="i0">infelix Dido, longumque bibebat amorem</span>
<span class="i0">multa super Priamo rogitans, super Hectore multa, etc.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>After the shade of Creusa had told him of his destiny,
which she was not to share, the past was still in his mind,
and he seems to have forgotten the warning; he calls
himself an exile (iii. 10):</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">litora cum patriae lacrimans portusque relinquo</span>
<span class="i0">et campos ubi Troia fuit. Feror exsul in altum&mdash;</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>I find an exception after the meeting with Andromache,
when he thinks of the future for a moment, but even then
half-heartedly as it seems to me, with a very distinct
reluctance to face the dangers to come, and with a touching
envy of those who could "stay at home at ease" (iii. 493
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>foll.). His want of faith in the future is again shown in
Book v., in the passage quoted just now; and even in
Book vi. he is at first purposely depicted as "slack," as
having his attention caught by what is for the moment
before him, or with the figures of old friends and enemies
whom he meets, until the last awakening revelation of
Anchises. Thus no sooner has he landed in Italy than
he is attracted by the pictures in the temple of Apollo and
incurs a rebuke from the priestess (vi. 37 foll.):</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">non hoc ista sibi tempus spectacula poscit;</span>
<span class="i0">nunc grege de intacto septem mactare iuvencos</span>
<span class="i0">praestiterit, etc.;</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>so also a little farther on she has to warn him again
(50 foll.) at the entrance to the cave:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5_5">"cessas in vota precesque,</span>
<span class="i0">Tros" ait "Aenea, cessas?"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>It may be fancy in me to see even in his prayer which
follows a leaning to think of Troy and his past troubles
(56 foll.). But I cannot but believe that in this book he
is meant to take a last farewell of all who have shared
his past fortunes, have helped him or injured him; he
meets Palinurus, Dido, Tydeus, Deiphobus, and the rest,
and while meditating over these he has once more to be
hurried by his guide (538):</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">sed comes admonuit breviterque adfata Sibylla est:</span>
<span class="i0">nox ruit, Aenea, nos flendo ducimus horas.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When Anchises appears the whole tone changes, and
his famous words seem to me to show conclusively that
hesitation and want of fixed, undeviating purpose had
been so far his son's chief failing (806):</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">et dubitamus adhuc virtutem extendere factis,</span>
<span class="i0">aut metus Ausonia prohibet consistere terra?</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The father's vision and prophecy are of the <i>future</i> and
the great deeds of men to come, and henceforward Aeneas
makes no allusion to the past and the figures that peopled
it, abandons talk and lamentations, "virtutem extendit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>factis." At the outset of Book vii. we feel the ship moving
at once; three lines suffice for the fresh start; Circe is
passed unheeded. "Maior rerum mihi nascitur ordo,"
says the poet in line 43; "maius opus moveo;" for the
real subject of the poem is at last reached, and a heroic
character by heroic deeds is to lay the foundation of the
eternal dominion of Rome.</p>

<p>A very few words shall suffice about the Aeneas of the
later books. Let us freely allow that he is not strongly
characterised; that for us moderns the interest centres
rather in Turnus, who is heroic as an individual, but not
as a pioneer of civilisation divinely led; that there is no
real heroine, for feminine passion would be here out of
place and un-Roman, and the courtship of Lavinia is
undertaken, so to speak, for political reasons. The r&ocirc;le
of Aeneas, as the agent of Jupiter in conquest and civilisation,
would appeal to a Roman rather than to a modern,
and it was reserved for the modern critic to complain of a
lack of individual interest in him. So, too, it is in Jewish
history; we feel with Esau more than with Jacob, and with
David more than with Moses, who is none the less the
grandest typical Israelite in the Old Testament. And,
indeed, Virgil's theme here is less the development of a
character or the portraiture of a hero than the idealisation
of the people of the Italy which he loved so well, who
needed only a divinely guided leader and civiliser to enter
upon the glorious career that was in store for them.</p>

<p>I cannot escape the belief, as I read again through
these books, that Virgil did intend to depict in Aeneas
his ideal of that Roman character to which the leading
writers of his day ascribed the greatness of their race.
His <i>pietas</i> is now confirmed and enlarged, it has become a
sense of duty to the will of the gods as well as to his
father, his son, and his people, and this sense of duty never
leaves him, either in his general course of action or in the
detail of sacrifice and propitiation. His courage and
steadfastness never fail him; he looks ever forward, confident
in divine protection; the shield he carries is adorned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>&mdash;a wonderful stroke of poetic genius&mdash;with scenes of the
future, and not of the past (viii. 729 foll.):</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">talia per clipeum Volcani, dona parentis,</span>
<span class="i0">miratur rerumque ignarus imagine gaudet</span>
<span class="i0">attollens umero famamque et fata nepotum.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>He is never in these books to be found wanting in
swiftness and vigilance; when he cheers his comrades it
is no longer in a half-hearted way, but as at the beginning
of the eleventh book, with the utmost vigour and confidence,
"Arma parate, animis et spe praesumite bellum"
(xi. 18).</p>

<p>His <i>humanitas</i> again is here more obvious than in his
earlier career, and it is plainly meant to be contrasted with
the heroic savagery of Mezentius and Turnus. So keenly
did the poet feel this development in his hero's character,
that in his descriptions of the death of Lausus and the
burial of Pallas&mdash;noble and beautiful youths whom he
loved in imagination as he loved in reality all young
things&mdash;his tenderness is so touching that even now we
can hardly read them without tears. And not only is the
hero heroic and humane, but he is a just man and keeps
faith; when, in the twelfth book, the Rutulians break the
treaty, and his own men have joined in the unjust combat
(xii. 311):</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">at pius Aeneas dextram tendebat inermem</span>
<span class="i0">nudato capite atque suos clamore vocabat:</span>
<span class="i0">"quo ruitis? quove ista repens discordia surgit?</span>
<span class="i0">o cohibete iras; ictum iam foedus et omnes</span>
<span class="i0">compositae leges: mihi ius concurrere soli."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>He claims for himself alone, under the guiding hand of
providence, the right to deal with Turnus, the enemy of
humanity and righteousness. And we may note that
when it came to that last struggle, though conquering by
divine aid, he was ready to spare the life of the conquered
till he saw the spoils of the young Pallas upon him.</p>

<p>The character of Aeneas, then, though not painted in
such strong light as we moderns might expect or desire, is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span><i>intentionally</i> developed into a heroic type in the course of
the story&mdash;a type which every Roman would recognise as
his own natural ideal. And this growth is the direct
result of religious influence. It is partly the result of the
hero's own natural <i>pietas</i>, innate within him from the first,
as it was in the breast of every noble Roman; partly the
result of a gradually enlarged recognition of the will of
God, and partly of the strengthening and almost sacramental
process of the journey to Hades, of the revelation
there made of the mysteries of life and death, and of the
great future which Jupiter and the Fates have reserved
for the Roman people. In these three influences Virgil
has summed up all the best religious factors of his day:
the instinct of the Roman for religious observance, with
all its natural effect on conduct; the elevating Stoic
doctrine which brought man into immediate relation with
the universal; and, lastly, the tendency to mysticism,
Orphic or Pythagorean, which tells of a yearning in the
soul of man to hope for a life beyond this, and to make
of this life a meet preparation for that other.</p>

<p>Only one word more. We can hardly doubt the truth
of the story that the poet died earnestly entreating that
this greatest work of his life should perish with him, and
this may aptly remind us that though I have been treating
the Aeneid as a poem of religion and morals, yet, after
all, Virgil was a poet rather than a preacher, and thought
of his Aeneid, not as a sermon, but as a work of art. Had
he thought of it as a sermon he could hardly have wished
to deprive the Roman world of it. The true poet is never
a preacher except in so far as he is a poet. If the Greeks
thought of their poets as teachers, says the late Prof.
Jebb, "this was simply a recognition of poetry as the
highest influence, intellectual and spiritual, that they
knew." "It was not merely a recreation of their leisure,
but a power pervading and moulding their whole existence."
Surely this is also true of Virgil, and of the best
at least of his Roman readers. No one can read the sixth
Aeneid, the greatest effort of his genius, without feeling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>that poetry was all in all to him; that learning, legend,
philosophy, religion, whatever in the whole range of human
thought and fancy entered his mind, emerged from it as
poetry and poetry only.<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">899</a></p>

of God in the <i>Aeneid</i> is its weakest point. It was an epic poem,
and could not dispense with the Homeric machinery: hence Jupiter
is practically the representative of the Stoic all-pervading deity, with
the Fates behind him. But it is not unlikely that Virgil may thus
have actually helped to make the way clear for a nobler monotheistic
idea by damaging Jupiter in the course of this treatment; see <i>Social
Life at Rome in the Age of Cicero</i>, p. 341 foll.</p></div>

of the point, but that it immediately follows upon the doubtful
lines 567-588, in which Aeneas is tempted in his mad fury to
slay Helen; and if those lines are not Virgil's, we have not sufficient
explanation of the rebuke which Venus here administers to
her son. On the other hand, if they were really Virgil's, and
omitted (as Servius declares) by the original editors Tucca and
Varius, we should have a convincing proof that the poet meant his
hero, in these terrible scenes, to come so short of the true Roman
heroic type as to be capable of slaying a woman in cold blood, and
while a suppliant at an altar of the gods. Into this much-disputed
question I must not go farther, except to note that while Heinze is
absolutely confident that Virgil never wrote these lines, the editor of
the new Oxford text of Virgil is equally certain that he did. My
opinion is of no value on such a point; but I am disposed to agree
with Mr. Hirtzel that "versus valde Vergilianos, ab optimis codicibus
omissos, iniuria obleverunt Tucca et Varius." They are certainly
in keeping with the picture of Aeneas' <i>impotentia</i> which is generally
suggested in Book ii. If it should be argued that this <i>impotentia</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> want of self-control, is only put into the mouth of Aeneas in
order to heighten the effect of his stirring narrative, it will be well
to remember the remonstrances of Venus, which make such a
hypothesis impossible.</p></div>

enforced marriage with Iarbas, she killed herself to mark her
unflinching faithfulness to her first husband Sicharbas. Servius
quotes Varro as stating that it was not Dido, but Anna who committed
suicide for love of Aeneas (on <i>Aen.</i> iv. 682); and as Varro
died before the Aeneid was begun, this may be taken as proving
that Virgil's version of the love-story was not his own invention.
But it is quite possible that Servius here only means that Varro's
version differed in this point from that which the poet soon afterwards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>adopted; it may be that the story in the poem is thus practically

<h4>LECTURE XIX</h4>


<h5>THE AUGUSTAN REVIVAL</h5>


<p>It is a long descent from the inspiring idealism of Virgil
to the cool, tactical attempt of Augustus to revive the
outward forms of the old religion. It seems strange that
two men so different in character and upbringing should
have been working in the same years in the same direction,
yet on planes so far apart. How far the two were
directly connected in their work we cannot know for
certain. It is said that the subject of the Aeneid was
suggested to Virgil by Augustus, and it is quite possible
that this may be true; but it by no means follows from
this that the inspiration of the poem came from any other
source but Virgil's own thought and feeling. We also
know that Augustus from the first appreciated the Aeneid,
and that he saved it for all time; but it is by no means
clear that it inspired him in his efforts towards moral
and religious regeneration. Perhaps the truth is that
both were moved by the wave of mingled depression and
hope that swept over Italy for some years after the death
of Julius, and that each used his experience in his own
way and according to his opportunities. They had at
least this in common, that they utilised the past to
encourage the present age, and that by filling old forms
and names with new meaning they set men's minds upon
thinking of the future.<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">900</a></p>

<p>Yet the revival of the State religion by Augustus is at
once the most remarkable event in the history of the
Roman religion, and one almost unique in religious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>history. I have repeatedly spoken of that State religion
as hypnotised or paralysed, meaning that the belief in the
efficacy of the old cults had passed away among the
educated classes, that the mongrel city populace had long
been accustomed to scoff at the old deities, and that the
outward practice of religion had been allowed to decay.
To us, then, it may seem almost impossible that the
practice, and to some extent also the belief, should be
capable of resuscitation at the will of a single individual,
even if that individual represented the best interests and
the collective wisdom of the State. For it is impossible
to deny that this resuscitation was real; that both <i>pax
deorum</i> and <i>ius divinum</i> became once more terms of
force and meaning. Beset as it was by at least three
formidable enemies, which tended to destroy it even while
they fed on it, like parasites in the animal or vegetable
world feeding on their hosts,&mdash;the rationalising philosophy
of syncretism, the worship of the Caesars, and the new
Oriental cults,&mdash;the old religion continued to exist for
at least three centuries in outward form, and to some
extent in popular belief.</p>

<p>We must remember the tenacious conservatism of
the Roman mind: the emotional stimulus of the age
of depression and despair which preceded this revival:
and the conscientious care with which the successors of
Augustus, Tiberius in particular, carried out his religious
policy.<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">901</a> Then as we become more familiar with the
Corpus of inscriptions and the writings of the early
Christian fathers, we begin to appreciate the fact that
the natural and inherited religion of a people cannot
altogether die, and that to describe this old Roman
religion as <i>dead</i> is to use too strong a word. The votive
inscriptions of the Empire show us overwhelming proof of
surviving belief in the great deities of the olden time, and
of the care taken of their temples. Antoninus Pius is
honoured "ob insignem erga caerimonias publicas curam
et religionem."<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">902</a> Marcus Aurelius himself did not hesitate
in times of public distress to put in action the whole
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>apparatus of the old religion.<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">903</a> Constantius in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 329
was shown round the temples when he visited Rome for
the first time, and in spite of his Christianity took a
curious interest in them.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">904</a> That the private worship, too,
went on into the fourth century we know from the
Theodosian code, where in the interest of Christianity
the worship of Lares Penates and Genius is strictly
forbidden.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">905</a> Again, the constant ridicule with which the
Christian writers speak of the <i>minutiae</i> of the heathen
worship makes it quite plain that they knew it as actually
existing, and not merely from books like those of Varro.
They do not so much attack the Oriental religions of
their time as the genuine old Roman cults; more especially
is this the case with St. Augustine, from whose <i>de
Civitate Dei</i> we have learnt so much about the latter. The
very necessity under which the leaders of Christianity
found themselves of suiting their own religious character,
and in some ways even their own ceremonies, to the
habits and prejudices of the pagans, tells the same story.
But the question how far Latin Christianity was indebted
to the religion of the Romans must be postponed to my
last lecture; I have said enough to indicate in which
direction we must go for evidence that the work of
Augustus was not in vain, that it gave fresh stimulus to
a plant that still had some life in it.</p>

<p>If, then, the Augustan revival was not a mere sham,
but had its measure of real success, how are we to
account for this? I think the explanation is not really
difficult, if we bring to bear upon the problem what we
have learnt from the beginning about the religious experience
of the Romans. Let us note that Augustus troubled
himself little about the later political developments of
religion, which we have lately been examining,&mdash;about
pontifices, augurs, and Sibylline books; these institutions,
which had been so much used in the republican period for
political and party purposes, it was rather his interest to
keep in the background. But in one way or another he
must have grasped the fundamental idea of the old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>Roman worship, that the prosperity and the fertility of
man, and of his flocks and herds and crops on the farm,
and the prosperity and fertility of the citizen within the
city itself, equally depended on the dutiful attention
(<i>pietas</i>) paid to the divine beings who had taken up their
abode in farm or city.<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">906</a> The best expression of this idea
in words is <i>pax deorum</i>,&mdash;the right relation between man
and the various manifestations of the Power,&mdash;and the
machinery by which it was secured was the <i>ius divinum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">907</a>
We shall not be far wrong if we say that it was Augustus'
aim to re-establish the <i>pax</i> by means of the <i>ius</i>; but if we
wished to explain the matter to some one who has not
been trained in these technical terms, it would be better
to say that he appealed to a deeply-rooted idea in the
popular mind,&mdash;the idea that unless the divine inhabitants
were properly and continually propitiated, they would not
do their part in supporting the human inhabitants in all
their doings and interests. This popular conviction he
deliberately determined to use as his chief political lever.</p>

<p>This has, I think, been insufficiently emphasised by
historians, who contemplate the work of this shrewd
statesman too entirely from the political point of view. I
am sure that he had learnt from his predecessors in power
that reform on political lines only was without any
element of stability, and that he knew that it was far
more important to touch a spring in the feeling of the
people, than to occupy himself, like Sulla, in mending old
machinery or inventing new. If he could but induce
them to believe in him as the restorer of the <i>pax deorum</i>,
he knew that his work was accomplished. And I believe
that we have what is practically his own word for this
conviction; not in his Res Gestae, the <i>Monumentum
Ancyranum</i>, which is a record of facts and of deeds only,
but in the famous hymn which Horace wrote at his
instance and to give expression to his ideas, for use in the
Secular Games of 17 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, to which I am coming presently.
Ferrero has lately described that hymn as a magnificent
poem,<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">908</a> an opinion which to me is incomprehensible. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>is neat, and embodies the necessary ideas adequately, but
it is far too flat to be the genuine offspring of such a
poet as Horace. To me it reads as though Augustus had
written it in prose and then ordered his poet to put it
into metre; and assuredly it expresses exactly what we
should have expected Augustus to wish to be sung by his
youthful choirs. I shall refer to it again shortly to illustrate
another point; all I need say now is that he who
reads it carefully and thinks about it will find there the
conviction of which I have been speaking, that prosperity
and fertility, whether of man, beast, or crop, depend on
the Roman's attitude toward his deities; religion, morality,
fertility, and public concord are the points which the
astute ruler wished to be emphasised.<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">909</a> That this hymn
was a really important part of the ceremony is certain
from the fact that it was given to the best living poet to
write, and that his name is mentioned as its author in the
inscription, discovered not many years ago, which commemorated
the whole performance: "CARMEN COMPOSUIT
Q. HORATIUS FLACCUS."<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">910</a></p>

<p>If, then, I am right, this strange movement was not
merely a revival of religious ceremonies, but an appeal
through them to the conscience of the people. A revival
of religious <i>life</i> it, of course, was not, for what we understand
by that term had never existed at Rome; but it
was an attempt to give expression, in a religious form and
under State authorisation, to certain feelings and ideas not
far removed in kind from those which in our own day we
describe as our religious experience. Whether Augustus
himself shared in these feelings and ideas it is, of course,
impossible to conjecture. But as a man's religious convictions
are largely the result of his own experience and
of that of the society in which he lives, and as Augustus'
own experience for the twenty years before he took this
work in hand had been full of trial and temptation, I am
disposed to guess that he was rather expressing a popular
conviction which he shared himself than merely standing
apart and administering a remedy. And this view seems
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>to me to be on the whole confirmed by the tone and spirit
of the great literary works of the age.</p>

<p>Augustus did not become pontifex maximus till the
year 12 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, nineteen years after he had crushed Antony
at Actium; he waited with scrupulous patience until the
headship of the Roman religion became vacant by the
death of Lepidus.<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">911</a> But this did not prevent him from
pursuing his religious policy with great earnestness before
that date, for he had long been a member of the pontifical
college, as well as augur and quindecemvir. No sooner had
he returned to Rome from Egypt than the work of temple
restoration began, the outward and visible sign to all that
the <i>pax deorum</i> was to be firmly re-established. The fact
of the restoration he has told us in half a dozen words in
his own Res Gestae:<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">912</a> "Duo et octaginta templa deum
in urbe ex decreto senatus refeci," adding that not one
was neglected that needed repair. Among them was that
oldest and smallest temple of Jupiter Feretrius on the
Capitol to which I referred in a former lecture;<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">913</a> and his
personal interest in the work is attested by Livy, who
says that he himself heard Augustus tell how he had
found an inscription, relating to the second <i>spolia opima</i>
dedicated there, when he went into the temple bent on
the work of restoration.<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">914</a> It needs but a little historical
imagination to appreciate the psychological importance of
all this work. We have to think not only of the bystanders
who watched, but of the very workmen themselves,
rejoicing at once in new employment and in the
revival of an old sense of religious duty. Little more
than twenty years earlier, no workman could be found to
lay a hand upon the newly-built temple of Isis, when the
consul Aemilius Paulus gave orders for its destruction
as a centre of <i>superstitio</i>;<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">915</a> now abundant work was
provided which every man's conscience would approve.
When I think of the Rome of that year 28, with all its
fresh hope and confidence taking visible shape in this
way, even Horace's famous lines seem cold to me (<i>Od.</i>
ii. 6. 1):</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>delicta maiorum immeritus lues</span>
<span class="i0">Romane, donec templa refeceris</span>
<span class="i1">aedesque labentis deorum et</span>
<span class="i2">foeda nigro simulacra fumo.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The restoration of the temple buildings implies also a
revival of the old ritual, the <i>cura et caerimonia</i>. As to this
we are very imperfectly informed,&mdash;we have no correspondence
of this age, as of the last, and the details of life in
the Augustan city are not preserved in abundance. But
Ovid comes to the rescue here, as in secular matters, and
on the whole the evidence in his <i>Fasti</i> suggests that the
old sacrificing priesthoods, the Rex and the flamines, were
set to their work again. He tells us, for example, how he
himself, as he was returning to Rome from Nomentum,<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">916</a>
had seen the flamen Quirinalis carrying out the <i>exta</i> of
a dog and a sheep which had been sacrificed in the
morning in the city, to be laid on the altar in the grove
of Robigus. In spite of all its disabling restrictions, it
was possible once more to fill the ancient priesthood of
Jupiter; and of the Rex sacrorum and the other flamines
we hear in the early Empire.<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">917</a> They were in the <i>potestas</i>
of the pontifex maximus, and as after 12 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> that position
was always held by the Princeps himself, it was not
likely that they would be allowed to neglect their duties.
Other ancient colleges were also revived or confirmed by
the inclusion of the Emperor himself among their members
(a fact which Augustus was careful to record in his own
words), <i>e.g.</i> the Fetiales, of whom he had made use when
declaring war with Antony and Cleopatra;<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">918</a> the Sodales
Titienses, an institution of which we have lost the origin
and meaning; the Salii, Luperci, and above all the Fratres
Arvales, the brotherhood whose duty it had once been
to lead a procession round the crops in May, and so to
ensure the <i>pax deorum</i> for the most vital material of
human subsistence. The corn-supply now came almost
entirely from Africa and Egypt; the inner meaning of
this old ritual could not be revived, and we must own that
all this restoration of the old <i>caerimonia</i> must have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>appealed rather to the eye than the mind of the beholder.
It was necessary to put some new element into it to give
it life. Here we come upon a most important fact in the
work of Augustus, which will become apparent if we take
a rapid glance at the work and history of the Fratres, and
then go on to find further illustration of the curious
mixture of old and new which the Roman religion was
henceforward to be.</p>

<p>The fortunate survival of large fragments of the records
of the Brotherhood, dating from shortly after the battle of
Actium, show that it continued to work and to flourish
down to the reign of Gordian (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 241), and from other
sources we know that it was still in existence in the
fourth century.<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">919</a> These records have been found on the
site of the sacred grove, at the fifth milestone on the via
Campana between Rome and Ostia, which from the time
of this revival onwards was the centre of the activity of
the Fratres.</p>

<p>The brethren were twelve in number, with a <i>magister</i>
at their head and a flamen to assist him; they were
chosen from distinguished families by co-optation, the
reigning Emperor being always a member.<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">920</a> Their duties
fell into two divisions, which most aptly illustrate respectively
the old and the new ingredients in the religious
prescriptions of Augustus, as they were carried out by his
successors. The first of these is the performance of the
yearly rites in honour of the Dea Dia, the goddess or
<i>numen</i> without a substantival name (a form perhaps of
Ceres and Tellus), whose home was in the sacred grove,
and who was the special object of this venerable cult.
Secondly, the care of vows, prayers, and sacrifices for the
Emperors and other members of the imperial house. I
must say a few words about each of these divisions of
duty.</p>

<p>The worship of the Dea Dia took place in May on
three days, with an interval always of one day between
the first and second, according to the old custom of the
calendar.<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">921</a> On the first, preliminary rites were performed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>at Rome, in the house of the magister; on the second was
the most important part of the whole ceremony, which
took place at the sacred grove. These rites will give a
good idea of the old Roman worship, and of the exactness
with which Augustus sought to restore it. At dawn the
magister sacrificed two <i>porcae piaculares</i> to the Dea, and
then a <i>vacca honoraria</i>, after which he laid aside the <i>toga
praetexta</i> or sacrificial vestment, and rested till noon, when
all the brethren partook of a common meal, of which the
<i>porcae</i> formed the chief part. Then resuming the <i>praetexta</i>,
and crowned with wreaths of corn-ears, they proceeded
to the altar in the grove, where they sacrificed the
<i>agna opima</i>, which was the principal victim in the whole
ceremonial.<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">922</a> Other rites followed, <i>e.g.</i> the passing round,
from one to another of the brethren, fruits gathered and
consecrated on the previous day, each brother receiving
them in his left, <i>i.e.</i> lucky hand, and passing them on
with his right; and the singing of the famous Arval hymn
to Mars and the Lares to a rhythmic dance-tune. Then
after another meal and chariot-racing in the neighbouring
circus, they returned to Rome and finished the day with
further feasting.<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">923</a> A cynical reader of these Acta might
suggest that the appetites of the good brethren were
made more of than their <i>pietas</i>; but the feasting may be
just as much a part of the ancient practice as any of the
other curiosities of ritual.</p>

<p>The utensils employed were of the primitive sun-baked
clay (<i>ollae</i>), and seem to have been regarded with a
veneration almost amounting to worship.<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">924</a> Long ago I
had occasion to note how the old form of piacular sacrifice
was used and recorded whenever iron was taken into the
grove, or any damage done to the trees by lightning or
other accident. Once, when a tiny fig-tree sprouted on
the roof of the temple, piacula of all suitable kinds had
to be offered to Mars, Dea Dia, Janus, Jupiter, Juno,
Virgines divae, Famuli divi, Lares, Mater Larum, sive
deus sive dea in cuius tutela hic lucus locusque est, Fons,
Hora, Vesta Mater, Vesta deorum dearumque, Adolenda
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>Commolenda Deferunda,&mdash;and sixteen <i>divi</i> of the imperial
families!<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">925</a> As the date of this extraordinary performance
is <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 183, nothing can better show the extent to
which the revival of elaborate ritual had been carried by
Augustus, and the amazing tenacity with which it held its
ground.</p>

<p>The second part of the activity of the brethren well
illustrates the new element which Augustus adroitly
insinuated into the old religious forms: but I shall
not dwell upon it, for the worship of the Caesars in its
developed form is not of either Roman or Italian origin,
any more than the other kinds of cult which were now
pressing in from the East; and it thus lies outside the
range of my subject. The revival of this old priesthood,
and doubtless of others, the Salii for example, was turned
to account to mark the sacred character and political and
social predominance of the imperial family. All events of
importance in the life of the Emperor himself and his
family were the occasion of vows, prayers, or thanksgivings
on the part of the Fratres; births, marriages,
successions to the throne, journeys and safe return, and
the assumption of the consulship and other offices or
priesthoods. These rites all took place at various temples
or altars in Rome, or at the Ara Pacis, recently excavated,
which Augustus had built in the Campus Martius.
Here, by way of example of them, is a "votum susceptum
pro salute novi principis," on his accession.<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">926</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>This record, which belongs to the year 69 and the
accession of Otho, shows the <i>divi</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the deified emperors
Augustus and Claudius, together with the deified Livia,
associated with the <i>trias</i> of the Capitoline temple and
the <i>Salus publica</i> in the sacrificial rites. But under the
Flavian dynasty which followed this association was
judiciously dropped.<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">927</a> It may serve for the moment to
illustrate what was to come of this new element so subtly
introduced into the old worship; how it led to practices
which are utterly repulsive to us, and repulsive too to
an honest man even in that day. The noble words of
Tiberius, declining to have temples erected to him in
Spain, have been preserved by Tacitus from the senatorial
records:<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">928</a> "Ego me, patres conscripti, mortalem esse
fateor"; and he added that his only claim to immortality
lay in the due performance of duty. Tiberius, whatever
else he may have been, was beyond doubt an honest man;
and so too was Seneca, the author of the famous skit on the
deification of Claudius. But the extravagances of Caesar-worship
are not to be met with in Augustus' time; for
him the new element may be defined, as in Rome (and in
Italy too, so far as his own wish could limit it) nothing
more than <i>the encouragement of the belief in him, and
loyalty to him as the restorer of the pax deorum</i>. To this
end he sought to magnify his own achievements as
avenger of the crime of the murder of Julius, by which
the <i>pax</i> had been grievously disturbed. I propose to
finish this lecture by giving some account of the way in
which he attained this object. Let us briefly examine the
famous ritual of the <i>Ludi saeculares</i>, of which we have
more detailed knowledge than of any other Roman rite
of any period; it marks the zenith of his prosperity and
religious activity, and belongs to the year 17 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, two
years after the death of Virgil,&mdash;a date which may be
said to divide the long power of Augustus into two nearly
equal halves.</p>

<p>This famous celebration is an epoch in the history of
the Roman religion, if not in the history of Rome herself.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>It stands on the very verge of an old and a new r&eacute;gime.
It was the outward or ritualistic expression of the idea,
already suggested by Virgil in the fourth <i>Eclogue</i> and the
<i>Aeneid</i>, that a regeneration is at hand of Rome and Italy,
in religion, morals, agriculture, government; old things are
put away, new sap is to run in the half-withered trunk
and branches of a noble tree. The experience of the past,
as with Aeneas after the descent into Hades, is to lead to
new effort and a new type of character, of which <i>pietas</i>
in its broadest sense is the inspiring motive. Henceforward
the Roman is to look ahead of him in hope
and confidence, <i>virtutem extendere factis</i>. Augustus, the
Aeneas of the actual State, was firmly established in a
prestige which extended beyond Italy even to the far
East; his faithful and capable coadjutor Agrippa was by
his side to take his part in the ritual, and no cloud in that
year 17 seemed to be visible on the horizon.</p>

<p>The <i>Ludi saeculares</i> are also unique in respect of the
records we have of them. By wonderful good fortune we
can construct an almost complete picture of what was
done in that year on the last days of May and the first
three of June. We have the text of the Sibylline oracle,&mdash;how
manufactured we do not know, nor does it much
matter,&mdash;which prescribed the ritual, preserved by Zosimus,
a Greek historian of the fifth century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, together with
his own account.<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">929</a> Thus the outline of the ritual has been
known all along, together with many details; and to help
it out we have also the perfect text of the hymn written
by Horace for the occasion, and sung by two choirs of
boys and girls respectively. But great was the delight
of the learned world when, in September 1890, workmen
employed on the Tiber embankment, close, as it turned
out, to the spot where the nightly rites of the <i>ludi</i> took
place, came upon a mediaeval wall partly made of ancient
material, in which some marbles were found covered with
inscriptions relating to this same celebration.<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">930</a> This
treasure was badly mutilated, but the inscription was
easily decipherable; it contains a letter from Augustus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>giving instructions, two decrees of the Senate, and a series
of records of the Quindecemviri, who were of course in
charge of a ritual which had been ordered by a Sibylline
oracle. Some few points were at first puzzling, but have
been cleared up since the discovery. Mommsen, of course,
took the work in hand, and his exposition is still, and
always will be, the starting-point for students. Wissowa
has an excellent popular account of it, and recently, in the
fifth volume of his <i>Greatness and Decline of Rome</i>, Ferrero
has utilised it to give an animated account of the whole
ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">931</a></p>

<p>The <i>Ludi saeculares</i> take their name from the word
<i>saeculum</i>; and the old Italian idea of a <i>saeculum</i> seems
to have been a period stretching from any given moment
to the death of the oldest person born at that moment,&mdash;a
hundred years being the natural period so conceived.<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">932</a>
Thus a new saeculum might begin at any time, and might
be endowed with special religious significance by certain
solemn ceremonies; in this way the people might be
persuaded that a new leaf, so to speak, had been turned
over in their history: that all past evil, material or moral,
had been put away and done with (<i>saeculum condere</i>),
and a new period entered on of innocence and prosperity.
There are faint traces of three early celebrations of this
kind, beginning in 463 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, traditionally a disastrous year,
and renewed in 363 and 263. But in 249, another year
of distress and peril, a new saeculum was entered on with
a new and a Greek ritual, ordered by a Sibylline oracle.
A subterranean altar in a spot by the Tiber, near the
present Ponte St. Angelo, and called Tarentum (possibly
to mark the original home of the rite), was dedicated to
Dis and Proserpina, Greek deities of the nether world;
and here for three successive nights black victims were
offered to them. The subterranean altar and the use of
the word <i>condere</i> (to put away), might suggest that this
rite may have had something in common with those well-known
quasi-dramatic ones in which objects are <i>buried</i> or
thrown into the water, to represent the cessation of one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>period of vegetation and the beginning of another.<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">933</a> Or
we may look on it in the light of one of those <i>rites de
passage</i> in which a transition is made from one state of
things to another, without any definite religious idea being
attached to it. There is no doubt some mystical element
in the primitive idea of the beginning and ending of periods
of time, which has not as yet been thoroughly investigated.<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">934</a></p>

<p>Now it is easy to see how exactly a rite of this kind,
with suitable modifications, would fit in with Augustus'
purposes as we have explained them. Fortunately too
Varro had in 42 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> published a book in which the
mystic or Pythagorean doctrine was set forth of the
palingenesis of All Souls after four saecula of 110 years
each; the fourth <i>Eclogue</i> of Virgil may have been
influenced by this, among other mystical ideas, as it was
written only three years later; and in any case the
doctrine was well known.<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">935</a> But Augustus had to wait a
while, until peace and confidence were restored. Why
eventually he chose the year 17 is quite uncertain; it
does not exactly fit in with any calculation of four saecula
of 110 years starting from any known date. But a
saeculum, as we have seen, might begin at any moment;
and in any case it was easy to manufacture a calculation,
which was now duly accomplished by trusty persons, chief
among them being the great lawyer, Ateius Capito, an
ardent adherent of Augustus and his projects.<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">936</a> Probably
too it was necessary to take advantage of the popular
feeling of the moment, that a better time had come, and
that it should be started on its way in some fitting outward
form.</p>

<p>So an elaborate programme was drawn up, the main
features of which I must now explain. On 26th May
and the two following days (for the mystic numbers three,
nine, and twenty-seven are noticeable throughout the
ritual)<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">937</a> the means of purification (<i>suffimenta</i>)&mdash;torches,
sulphur, bitumen<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">938</a>&mdash;were distributed by the priests to all
free persons, whether citizens or not; for this once, all in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>Rome at the time, with the exception of slaves, were to
give an imperial meaning to the ceremony by their share
in it. Even bachelors, though forbidden to attend public
shows under a recent law <i>de maritandis ordinibus</i>, were
allowed to do so on this occasion. No doubt the idea
was that the whole people were to be purified from all
pollution of the past; it is what M. van Gennep calls a
<i>rite de s&eacute;paration</i>, the first step in a <i>rite de passage</i>. The
next three days all the people came to the Quindecemviri
at certain stated places, and made offerings of <i>fruges</i>, the
products of the earth, as we do at our harvest festivals;
these were the firstfruits of the coming harvest.<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">939</a> It may
be worth while to recall the facts that it was on these same
days that the procession of the Ambarvalia used to go
round the ripening crops, and that in the early days of
June the symbolic <i>penus</i> of Vesta was being cleansed to
receive the new grain.<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">940</a> That Augustus wished to
emphasise the importance of Italian agriculture is beyond
doubt, and is apparent also in the hymn of Horace,
<i>Fertilis frugum pecorisque Tellus spicea donet Cererem
corona, etc.</i></p>

<p>When the <i>suffimenta</i> had been distributed and the offerings
made, all was ready for the putting away or burying of
the old <i>saeculum</i>. On the night before 1st June Augustus
himself, together with Agrippa, sacrificed to the Greek
Moirae, the Parcae of Horace's hymn, perhaps in some
sense the Fata of the <i>Aeneid</i>; on the second night to
Eilithyia, the Greek deity of childbirth; and on the third
to Mother Tellus. The form of prayer accompanying the
sacrifice is preserved in the inscription; it is Latin in
language and form, as dry and concise as any we examined
in my lectures on ritual, and contains the <i>macte esto</i> which
I was then at pains to explain. Augustus prayed for the
safety and prosperity of the State in every way, and also
for himself, his house, and his familia.<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">941</a> The scene on the
bank of the Tiber, illuminated by torches, must have been
most impressive.</p>

<p>These were the nightly ceremonies. But each day also
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>had its ritual, in which the Roman deities of the heaven
were the objects of worship, not, as by the Tiber bank,
Greek deities of the earth and the nether world. On the
first two days Augustus and Agrippa offered the proper
victims to Jupiter and Juno respectively on the Capitol;
Minerva is omitted, and probably the other two are
reckoned in Greek fashion as a married pair. The form
of prayer was the same as that used by night, with the
necessary modifications. Thus the great Capitoline temple
and its deities have a full share of attention, and they go
too far who think that Augustus was so wanting in tact
as to put them in the shade.<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">942</a> But on the third and last
day the scene changes from the Capitol to the Palatine,
the residence of Augustus, where he had built his great
temple of Apollo; here for the first time in the ceremony
Horace's hymn was sung. On all the days and nights
there had been shows and amusements, and a hundred
and ten chosen matrons had taken solemn part in the
services.<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">943</a> But I must pass these over and turn in the
last place to the question, as interesting as it is old and
difficult, as to how and where Horace's hymn was sung,
and how we are to understand it.</p>

<p>The instructions given to the poet by Augustus are
obvious as we read the Carmen in the light of the ceremonial
of which it was to mark the conclusion. He was
to bring into it, as we have already seen, the ideas which
were to be revived and made resonant, of religion, morality,
and the fertility of man, beast, and crop; and they are all
there. He was also to include all the deities who had
been addressed in prayer both by day and night, by Tiber
bank and on the Capitol, and to give the most prominent
place to those who on this last day were worshipped on the
Palatine; to Apollo, for whom Augustus had built a great
temple close to his own house (<i>in privato solo</i><a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">944</a>), as his
own specially protecting deity since Actium, and Diana,
who as equivalent to Artemis, could not but be associated
with Apollo. Thus the deities of the hymn are both
Latin and Greek,<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">945</a> and this expresses the undoubted fact
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>that the religion of the Romans was henceforward to be
even in outward expression a cosmopolitan or Romano-Hellenic
one, in keeping with the fact that all free men of
every race might take part in this great festival. But it
cannot fail to strike every careful reader that the great
trias of the Capitol is hardly visible in the poem, though
Jupiter and Juno had been the chief objects of worship
on the two previous days. Jupiter is twice incidentally
named, but in no connection with the Capitol;<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">946</a> and it is
only when we read between the lines of the fourteenth
stanza that we discover Jupiter and Juno as the recipients
of the white oxen which had been sacrificed to them
there. I have already said that we must not make too
much of the neglect of Jupiter and Juno by Augustus;
but it is plain that he directed Horace not to make them
too prominent in this hymn, and I think it is quite
possible that Horace a little overdid his obedience.</p>

<p>The result of all this is that the hymn, in spite of its
neatness and adequacy, is wanting in spontaneity, and
presents the casual reader with an apparently unmeaning
jumble of Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. The
only way to clear it up is by taking it in immediate
relation with what we know about the places in which it
was sung. To me at last it has become clear enough in
all its main points; and I will give here my own results,
which do not altogether coincide with those of other
recent inquirers.</p>

<p>Before the discovery of the great inscription we knew
that this hymn was sung before the new temple of Apollo
on the Palatine; we now know that it was also sung on
the Capitol,<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">947</a> thus uniting in one performance the old
religion of republican Rome with the new imperial cult of
Apollo. But this new fact has, in my opinion, led to
misapprehensions both of the manner of singing and the
order of subjects in the hymn. Mommsen thought that
the first part was sung on the Palatine, the middle part on
the Capitol, and the last again on the Palatine, and he is
followed by Wissowa; and both seem to think it possible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>that there may have been singing too during the procession
from the one hill to the other.<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">948</a> I think we need
not trouble ourselves about the latter point, for the Via
Sacra, by which the procession must have gone, was far
too narrow and irregular to allow fifty-four singers, with
the <i>tibicines</i> who must have been accompanying them, to
walk and perform at the same time.<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">949</a> The inscription, too,
says plainly that the hymn was sung on the Palatine and
then on the Capitol, and by that plain statement of fact
we had better abide.</p>

<p>Now let us note that these two stations on the two
hills were the best possible positions for Augustus' purpose,
not only because of their religious importance, but because
they afforded the most spacious views of the city, now
everywhere adorned with new or restored buildings. The
temple of Apollo was built upon a large and lofty area at
the north-east end of the Palatine.<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">950</a> Recent excavations
have shown it to be some hundred yards broad by a
hundred and fifty in length, and Ovid, in a passage of his
<i>Tristia</i><a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">951</a> gives us an idea of its height:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">inde tenore pari gradibus sublimia celsis</span>
<span class="i1">ducor ad intonsi candida templa dei.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>On this area the choirs of boys and girls took their station,
facing the marble temple, on the <i>fastigium</i> of which was
represented the Sun driving his four-horse chariot.<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">952</a> After
singing, probably together, the first two stanzas or exordium
of the hymn, they addressed this Sol:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">alme Sol, curru nitido diem qui</span>
<span class="i0">promis et celas, aliusque et idem</span>
<span class="i0">nasceris, possis nihil urbe Roma</span>
<span class="i1">visere maius.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>As they sang these last words, they would turn towards
the city that lay behind them, and look over it to the
Tiber and the scene of the nightly sacrifices of the Tarentum;
and with the deities of these rites, who must of
course be taken before those of day and light, as in the
order of the festival, the next five stanzas are occupied:<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">953</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>Eilithyia, the Moirae (Parcae), and Tellus or Ceres. When
that duty is over they turn once more to the temple, and
the Greek deities of the Tarentum are mentioned no more.
Three stanzas are devoted to Apollo and Diana (Luna),
with a happy allusion to the <i>Aeneid</i>, and then once more
the choirs turn, and this time they face the Capitol; the
hymn is long, and these changes of movement would be
at once a relief to the singers and a pleasant sight to the
spectators. They address the deities of the Capitol in
appropriate language:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">di probos mores docili iuventae,</span>
<span class="i0">di, senectuti placidae quietem,</span>
<span class="i0">Romulae genti date remque prolemque</span>
<span class="i2">et decus omne.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The allusion to Jupiter and Juno is thus veiled:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">quaeque vos bobus veneratur albis</span>
<span class="i0">clarus Anchisae Venerisque sanguis,</span>
<span class="i0">impetret, bellante prior, iacentem</span>
<span class="i2">lenis in hostem.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Horace has cleverly made Augustus himself the leading
figure in this and the following stanza, and the listeners
forget the Capitoline gods as they note the allusion to
Venus, the ancestress of the Julii, the prestige of Augustus
that has brought envoys to him from Scythia, Media, and
India, and in the next stanza the public virtues, presented
here as deities&mdash;Fides, Pax, Honos, Pudor, Virtus&mdash;on
whose aid and worship the new r&eacute;gime is based.<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">954</a></p>

<p>At the sixteenth stanza the choirs again face about to
the temple of Apollo, and with him and Diana again the
next two stanzas have to do. Only one remains, in
which as an <i>exodos</i> we may be sure the two choirs of boys
and girls joined; it sums up the whole body of deities,
but with Apollo and Diana as the special objects of the
day's worship:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">haec Iovem sentire deosque cunctos</span>
<span class="i0">spem bonam certamque domum reporto,</span>
<span class="i0">doctus et Phoebi chorus et Dianae</span>
<span class="i2">dicere laudes.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>The performance on the Palatine was now over, and
the procession streamed down the hill to join the Via Sacra
near the Regia and the Vesta temple, and so to make
its way up to the Capitol, where the performance was
repeated.<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">955</a> Taking station at this noble point of view, he
who will can again follow its movement with the hymn
in his hand. The area in front of the Capitoline temple
looked across to the Palatine, and the image of Sol and
his <i>quadriga</i> must have been in full view; thus the
<i>exordium</i> and the next stanza (alme Sol) would be sung
looking in that direction. Equally well in view, if they
turned to the right, would be the scene of the midnight
sacrifices across the Campus Martius; and so on throughout
the singing the changes of position would be easy
and graceful, here as on the Palatine.</p>

<p>Here I prefer to make an end of the performance,
following the text of the inscription, which tells us nothing
of a return to the Palatine. It would be far more in
keeping with Roman practice that the Capitol should be
the scene of the conclusion of the processional ceremony,
even on a day when Apollo was, with Augustus himself,
the principal figure. From the musical point of view, too,
a third performance is improbable, for the singers were
young and tender.</p>

<p>And here, too, with this impressive scene, which can
hardly fail to move the imagination of any one who has
stood on Palatine and Capitol, I will close my account of
the religious experience of the Romans. A few remarks
only remain for me to make about its contribution, such
as it was, to the Latin form of Christianity.</p>

possibly morbid anxiety about religious matters and details of cult, of
which examples may be found in Tac. <i>Ann.</i> iii. 58, vi. 12, among
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>other passages. Perhaps, however, the most interesting is that
connected with the famous story of "the Great Pan is dead," told by
Plutarch in the <i>de Defectu Oraculorum</i>, ch. xvii. The news of this
strange story reached the ears of Tiberius, who at once set the
learned men about him to inquire into it; and they came to the no
less strange conclusion that "this was the Pan who was born of
Hermes and Penelope." S. Reinach has recently offered an explanation
of this story, which is at least better than previous ones, in
<i>Cultes, mythes, et religions</i>, vol. iii. p. 1 foll.</p></div>

<h4>LECTURE XX</h4>

<h4>CONCLUSION</h4>


<p>"A time of spiritual awakening, of a calling to higher
destinies, came upon the world, the civilised world which
lay around the Mediterranean Sea, at the beginning of
our era. The calling was concentrated in the life and
death of the Founder of Christianity."<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">956</a> The writer of
these words goes on to point out that the beginning of
our era was "a time of general stirring in all the higher
fields of human activity," and that all such stirring, all
that brings higher ideals before the minds of men of
action, of imagination, or of reflection, if not itself religion,
is in some sense religious, and in that age must be taken
into account as having some bearing on the origin of
Christianity, the greatest of all religious movements. And
inasmuch as the new spirit of the age seems to have put
new life into the old religious systems, with the help of
philosophy and poetry, as well as of a purer and more
effective conception of Man's relation to the Power
manifesting itself in the universe, he finds it useful and
legitimate to show how the ideas and characteristics of
the leading types of religion in the civilised world of
which he speaks were absorbed or "baptized" into the
spirit of Christianity. In other words, we may ask what
was the contribution of each of these religious types to
the formation of the Christian type of religion; for
however new was the inspiration which was the essential
living germ of our religion, yet that germ was of necessity
planted in soil full of other religious ingredients,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>which found their way into the sap of the plant as it
grew towards maturity.</p>

<p>I have all along wished to bring our subject, the
religious experience of the Roman people, into touch
with Christianity, whether by marking points of contact,
or of contrast, or both. In the last few lectures I have
laid stress on certain points likely to be useful to us in
this last stage of our studies, and these will, I hope,
furnish us with some amount of material. But I confess
that I have approached this subject with great hesitation.
What I shall have to say will be tentative and suggestive
only; but I hope that the account that I have given in
these lectures of Roman religious experience may be of
use in helping a better qualified student to carry on the
work more adequately.</p>

<p>Let us glance back for a moment at the results of the
last four lectures, in which I have been dealing with
Roman religious experience after the paralysis or hypnotism
of the old religion of the State. We saw, in the
first place, that the educated part of Roman society had
been brought to the very threshold of a new and more
elevating type of religion, by Greek philosophy transplanted
to Roman soil, and chiefly by Stoicism. True,
one great Epicurean genius had had his share in this
process, by denouncing the weakness and wickedness of
the Roman society, and the futility of all the religious
forms and fancies with which they still dallied; but
Lucretius had nothing to offer in the place of these forms
and fancies&mdash;nothing, that is, which could grip the conscience
and act as a real force upon conduct. The
Roman was in a religious sense destitute, both of a real
sense of duty to his fellow-men of all grades, and in
regard to God; and for this destitution Lucretius' remedy,
the accurate knowledge of a philosophical theory of the
universe, was wholly inadequate. The first real appeal
to the conscience of the Roman came from Stoicism, the
reasonable and less austere type of Stoicism which
Panaetius preached to the Scipionic circle. From this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>the Roman learnt that as a part of the divine universe
Man himself is divine: that as endowed with a portion
of that Reason which itself is God, he has a sacred duty
to perform in using it. Thus, as the Universal was revealed,
so the Individual was ennobled; and the only
thing wanting to make of this a real religion was a bond
that might unite the two more effectually in conduct as
well as in thought. Though a later development of
Stoicism did indeed all but achieve this union, that of the
later Republic failed to do so, because it inherited the
old Stoic neglect of the emotional side of man's nature,
and could take little advantage from a strong current of
mystical feeling that was running side by side with it.
The Stoic ingredient in the soil which was being prepared
for Christianity was rich and valuable, but in this one
respect it was poor. It was intellectually beautiful, but
it stirred as yet no "enthusiasm of humanity."<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">957</a></p>

<p>Another ingredient in the soil was that imaginative
transcendentalism which we discussed under the name of
Mysticism, in which the soul becomes of greater interest
than the body, and a strange yearning possesses the mind
to speculate on the nature of the soul, its existence before
this life, and its lot in another world. These imaginative
yearnings were not native to the Roman, who had never
had any very definite idea of a future life, nor had ever
troubled himself about a previous one; they filtered
through the Pythagorean and Platonic philosophy into
that type of later Stoicism which attracted him. They
were hardly treated in Roman society with real religious
earnestness, except perhaps in some few moments of
sorrow and emotion such as I dwelt on in the experience
of Cicero. But the mere fact that they were in the air
at Rome is of importance for us. They <i>stimulated the
imaginative faculty in religious thought</i>; they kept alive
in the minds at least of some men the questions why we
are here, what we are, and what becomes of us after
death. They prepared the Roman mind for Christian
eschatology; and this, though never so important in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>Latin Church as in the Greek, was yet an important part
of the teaching of the early Church. St. Paul exactly
expresses the yearning thus dimly foreshadowed in the
mystical movement of which I am speaking: "We that
are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for
that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed
upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life"
(2 Cor. v. 4). It was essential that the Roman should be
able to understand words like these, and to associate them
with a religion which, though in its most vital points one
mainly affecting this life, was also, like those of Isis and
Mithras, strongly tinged with mysticism. "All religions
of that time," it has lately been said, "were religions of
hope. Stress was laid on the future: the present time
was but for preparation. So in the mysterious cults of
Hellenism, whose highest aim is to offer guarantees for
other worldly happiness; so too in Judaism, whose legacy
has but the aim of furnishing the happy life in the kingdom
of the future. But Christianity is a religion of faith,
the gospel not only giving guarantees for the future life,
but bringing confidence, peace, joy, salvation, forgiveness,
righteousness&mdash;whatever man's heart yearns after."<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">958</a></p>

<p>Yet another ingredient was that kindly, charitable,
sympathetic outlook on the world which we found in the
poems of Virgil, and which is associated throughout them
with the idea of duty and honourable service. The
husbandman toiling cheerfully and doing his simple
acts of worship, among the patient animals that he loves,
and the scenes of natural beauty that inspire him with
pure and tender thoughts; and then again in the <i>Aeneid</i>
the warrior kept true to his goal by a sense of duty
stimulated by supernatural influence: both these sides
of the Virgilian spirit show well how the soil is being
prepared for another and a richer crop. Love and Duty
are the essentials of Christian ethics; they are both
to be found in this poet, and through him made their
way into the ideas of the better Romans of the next
generation, and so into the philosophy of Seneca and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>Marcus Aurelius. "To minds touched with the same
sense of life's problems which pervades the poetry of
Virgil, the ideas that came from Galilee brought the rest
and peace which they could not find elsewhere."<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">959</a> The
early Christian writers loved the "vates Gentilium," and
St. Augustine in particular is for ever quoting him; but
I should be going beyond the limits of my subject if I
were to follow his gentle influence farther down the
stream of time.</p>

<p>In my last lecture we discussed the revival of the old
religious forms by Augustus, and the consummation of
this work of his in the splendid ritual of the <i>Ludi saeculares</i>.
Can it be said that such an astute and worldly
policy as this had any value in the way of preparation
for Christianity? Only, I think, in one way; it renewed
the idea of the connection between religion and the State,
and of the religious duties of the individual citizen towards
the State. It preserved the outward features of the old
State religion, such as the calendar, the ritual, and the
terminology or vocabulary, and handed these down to a
time when they could be of service to a Latin Christian
church.<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">960</a> Had the old forms been allowed to go utterly
to rack and ruin, as they had been already doing for the
last two centuries, the Roman State would have been as
such without religion, or the worship of the Caesars would
have become disastrously powerful and prominent, or maybe
the State would have adopted the religion of Isis or Mithras
or some other Oriental cult and belief, before Christianity
could lay a firm grasp on it. I think it might be shown
that the continuity of the old religion in its connection
with the State was really of value in keeping these
growths from occupying too much ground: of value in
checking too rapid a growth of individualism:<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">961</a> of value
too in cherishing certain really precious religious characteristics,
orderliness and decency in ritual, for example,
which, as we have seen, were very early developed in the
Roman religious system, and which owed their continued
vitality to the overwhelming influence of the Roman State
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>over all her citizens and their ideas. Thus when at last,
after a period of anxious conflict between rival religions,
the State proclaimed itself Christian, and henceforward
for good or ill extended its protection to the Church, its
religious tradition was still one of decency and order,
still free from almost all that the old Roman State
knew and dreaded as <i>superstitio</i>. There was, in fact, a
legacy, not indeed a spiritual one, but yet one of some
small value, left by the old Roman religion to the Latin
Church: and this I will turn for a few minutes to
examine.</p>

<p>As an example of the orderly, sane, and decent character
which the Church inherited from the Roman religion,
I might recall what I said in Lecture IX. about <i>lustratio</i>,
that slow and orderly processional movement in which the
old Romans delighted, and which is familiar still to all
travellers in Italy.<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">962</a> Another is the tender and reverential
care for the resting-places of departed relatives. I am
not sure that Prof. Gardner is right in asserting that the
prayers for the dead of the Catholic Church took the
place of the worship of the dead in the Roman family;<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">963</a>
for it is not easy to say how far it is true that the dead
were ever really worshipped at Rome, and the idea of
prayer for the dead, if it can be traced to Roman sources
at all, may be rather due to those tendencies which we
discussed under Mysticism, than to anything inherent in
the old Roman attitude to the departed. None the less
there is in the <i>sacra privata</i> of the Parentalia, and especially
of the Caristia which concluded it&mdash;a kind of love-feast
of all members of the family, where all quarrels and
differences were to be laid aside,<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">964</a>&mdash;something that suggests
the Christian attitude towards the dead, and in
some dim way too the doctrine of the Communion of
Saints. And we may also notice how closely in regard
to externals the great events of family life,&mdash;those critical
moments when the aid of the <i>numina</i> was most needed&mdash;the
first days of infancy, the eras of puberty and of
marriage, passed on in their sober and orderly ritual into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>the baptism, confirmation, and sacramental wedding of
the Christian Church. In such ways the private religion
of the Roman family had doubtless a real continuity in
the new era, though the line of connection is difficult to
trace. This, and many other examples of survival, the
worship of local saints which took the place of that of
local deities, the use of holy water and of incense as
symbolic elements in worship, and the general resemblance
of the arrangement of festivals in the Calendars, Roman
and Christian, might be interesting matter for a complete
course of lectures, but must be omitted here.</p>

<p>Another point of interest, which might also be widely
expanded, is the influence of the Roman religious <i>spirit</i>,
as distinct from the outward form, on Christian thought
and literature in the Western half of the Empire. The
subtle transcendentalism of the Greek fathers was foreign
to Latin Christianity; the characteristics of Roman life
as reflected in Roman worship are plainly visible in the
Latin fathers. From Minucius Felix onwards, the Christians
who wrote in Latin, so far from being imaginative
and dreamy, are one and all matter-of-fact; historical,
abounding in illustration of life and conduct; ethical
rather than speculative; legal in their cast of thought
rather than philosophical; rhetorical in their manner of
expression rather than fervent or poetical. They were
well versed in the great literature of Rome, but most of
them, and especially the African school (which carried
Roman tendencies to an extreme), knew comparatively
little of Greek. St. Augustine, for example, could not
bring himself to work at Greek with ardour, nor could he
explain why this was so.<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">965</a> Of Augustine, as the type of
the literature of Latin Christianity, Bishop Westcott wrote
with something of an exaggerated criticism, lamenting
that he had not the Greek which had so large a place in
the Bishop's own training. "He looked" (more particularly
in the <i>de Civitate Dei</i>) "at everything from the side
of law and not of freedom: from the side of God, as an
irresponsible sovereign, and not of man, as a loving servant.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>In spite of his admiration for Plato, he was driven by a
passion for system" (how this reminds us of the old
Roman religious lawyers!) "to fix, to externalise, to freeze
every idea into a rigid shape. In spite of his genius he could
not shake off the influence of a legal and rhetorical training,
which controversy called into active exercise."<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">966</a> The
lecture from which I am quoting is an interesting one, on
the work and character of Origen, the great Alexandrian
of the third century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, with whom Augustine is contrasted,
as in an earlier age we might contrast Seneca
with Philo; the Latin writers rhetorical, practical, realistic;
the Greek authors idealistic and fervent, apt to see deep
moral significance in all human life. And this is really
the manner and mental attitude of all the famous Latin
fathers: of Lactantius, the clear, precise Ciceronian, whose
every page shows the perennial value of the Latin tongue;
of Tertullian, the subtle and acute rhetorician, more gifted
with imagination than his fellows; of Arnobius, another
Roman African, the reputed teacher of Lactantius.</p>

<p>One of the characteristics of these Latin fathers is
their fondness for using the famous words of the old
Roman religion, but in new senses. They inherit that
Roman love for a strong technical word of pregnant meaning
which has left us so many imperishable legacies in
terminology. <i>Municipium</i>, <i>colonia</i>, <i>imperium</i>, <i>collegium</i>,
rise in one's mind the moment the subject is mentioned;
and a few minutes' thought will reveal another score of
words which in various forms pervade all our modern
European terminology. So, too, with the language of
religion. These Latin advocates of Christian doctrine
took the old words which we have so often dwelt on in
the course of these lectures, and gave them new but almost
equally clear and pregnant meanings. Let us glance at
three or four of these; for such a legacy as this is no
mean property of the Christian religion of the West.</p>

<p>Let us take, to begin with, the greatest of all these
words&mdash;<i>religio</i>. I have maintained throughout these
lectures that the original sense of this word was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>natural feeling of man in the presence of the supernatural;
and though this has actually been questioned since I
began them,<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">967</a> I see no good reason to alter my conviction.
But in the age of Cicero and Lucretius the word
begins to take on a different meaning, of great importance
for the future. Though Cicero as a young man had
defined <i>religio</i> as "the feeling of the presence of a higher
or divine nature, which prompts man to worship,&mdash;to <i>cura
et caerimonia</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">968</a> yet later on in life he uses it with much
freedom of that <i>cura et caerimonia</i> apart from the feeling.
To take a single example among many: in a passage in
his <i>de Legibus</i> he says that to worship private or strange
or foreign gods, "confusionem habet religionum";<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">969</a> and
again he calls his own imaginary <i>ius divinum</i> in that
treatise a <i>constitutio religionum</i>, a system of religious
duties.<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">970</a> In many other passages, on the other hand, we
find both the feeling which prompts and the cult-acts
which follow on it equally connoted by the word; for
example, the phrase <i>religio sepulcrorum</i> suggests quite as
much the feeling as the ritual. So it would seem that
<i>religio</i> is already beginning to pass into the sense in
which we still use it&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, <i>the feeling which suggests worship,
and the forms under which we perform that worship</i>.
In this broad sense it is also used by Lucretius, who
included under it all that was for him the world's evil and
folly, both the feeling of awe which he believed to be
degrading, and the organised worship of the family and
the State, which he no less firmly believed to be futile.
"Tantum <i>religio</i> potuit suadere malorum."<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">971</a> The fact is
that in that age, when the old local character of the cults
was disappearing, and when men like Posidonius, Varro,
and Cicero were thinking and writing about the nature of
the gods and kindred subjects, a word was wanted to
gather up and express all this religious side of human life
and experience: it must be a word without a definite
technical meaning, and such a word was <i>religio</i>.</p>

<p>Thus while <i>religio</i> continues to express the feeling
only or the cult only, if called on to do so, it gains in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>age of Cicero a more comprehensive connotation, as the
result of the contemplation of religion by philosophy as
a thing apart from itself; and this enabled the early
Christian writers, who knew their Cicero well, to give it
a meaning in which it is still in use among all European
nations.</p>

<p>But there was yet to be a real change in the meaning
of the word, one that was inevitable, as the contrast between
Christianity and other religions called for emphasis.
The second century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> was that in which the competition
was keenest between various religious creeds and
forms, each with its own vitality, and each clearly marked
off from the others. It is no longer a question of religion
as a whole, contemplated by a critical or a sympathetic
philosophy; the question is, which creed or form is to be
the true and the victorious religion. Our wonderful word
again adapts itself to the situation. Each separate
religious system can now be called a <i>religio</i>. The old
polytheistic system can now be called <i>religio Deorum</i> by
the Christian, while his own creed is <i>religio Dei</i>. In the
<i>Octavius</i> of Minucius Felix, written about the end of the
second century, the word is already used in this sense.
<i>Nostra religio, vera religio</i>,<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">972</a> is for him the whole Christian
faith and practice as it stood then&mdash;the depth of
feeling and the acts which gave it outward form. The
one true religion can thus be now expressed by the word.
In Lactantius, Arnobius, Tertullian, in the third century
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, this new sense is to be found on almost every page,
but a single noble passage of Lactantius must suffice to
illustrate it. "The heathen sacrifice," he says, "and leave
all their religion in the temple; thus it is that such
<i>religiones</i> cannot make men good or firm in their faith.
But 'nostra <i>religio</i> eo firma est et solida et immutabilis,
quia mentem ipsam pro sacrificio habet, quia tota in
animo colentis est.'"<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">973</a></p>

<p>Here at last we come upon a force of meaning which
the word had never before attained. <i>Religio</i> here is not
awe only or cult only, but <i>a mental devotion capable of</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span><i>building up character</i>. "The kingdom of God is within
you." Surely this is a valuable legacy to the Christian
faith from our hard, dry, old Roman religion.</p>

<p>Another legacy in words is that of <i>pius</i>. Our English
word "pious" has suffered some damage from the sanctimoniousness
of a certain type of Puritanism; but <i>piety</i>
still remains sweet and wholesome, and, like its Latin
original in the middle ages it seems to express one
beautiful aspect of the Christian life better than any other
word. In the old Roman religion <i>pius</i> meant the man
who strictly conforms his life to the <i>ius divinum</i>; this we
know from the very definite ancient explanations of its
contrary, <i>impius</i>. The <i>impius</i> is the man who <i>wilfully</i>
breaks the <i>ius divinum</i> and the <i>pax deorum</i>; for him no
<i>piaculum</i> was of avail.<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">974</a> Such a crime is the nearest
approach in Roman antiquity to our idea of sin. <i>Pius</i> is
therefore, as we saw in discussing Aeneas, the man who
knows the will of the gods, and so far as in him lies
adjusts his conduct thereto, whether in the life of the
family or as a citizen of the State. As applied to things,
to a war for example, the word <i>pium</i> is almost equivalent
to <i>iustum</i> or <i>purum</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>pium bellum</i> is a war declared
and conducted in accordance with the principles of the
<i>ius divinum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">975</a> <i>Pietas</i> is therefore a virtue, that of obedience
to the will of God as shown in private and public
life, and it herein differs from <i>religio</i>, which is not a virtue,
but a feeling. But we need not be surprised to find that
in Lactantius <i>pietas</i> can be used to explain <i>religio</i>; for
<i>religio</i> is no longer a feeling only or a cult only, but, as
we saw just now, a mental devotion capable of building
up character. In one passage he says that it is no true
philosophy which "veram religionem, id est summam
pietatem, non habet."<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">976</a> In another interesting chapter
he shows plainly enough that he uses <i>pietas</i> just as he
uses <i>religio</i>, to express the whole Christian mental furniture.<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">977</a>
He begins by scornfully pointing to Aeneas as
the typical <i>pius</i>, and asking what we are to think of the
<i>pietas</i> of a man who could bind the hands of prisoners
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>in order to slaughter them as a sacrifice to the shade of
Pallas<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">978</a> (little dreaming, indeed, that Christian piety
should ever be guilty of such slaughter in the cause of
the faith); and ends by asking, "What, then, is <i>pietas</i>?
Surely it is with those who know not war; who keep at
peace with all men; who love their enemies and count
all men their brethren; who can control their anger and
curb all mental wilfulness." And once again, <i>pietas</i> is
the main ingredient in <i>iustitia</i>, that is, in Christian righteousness,
for "pietas nihil aliud est quam Dei notio."
Even here it is not so far removed from its old meaning;
but in a Christian writer it can mean conformity to
the will of God, based on a real knowledge of Him, in a
sense which shows us by a sudden illuminating flash the
deep gulf set between the old religion and the new.</p>

<p>Another word, bequeathed in this case rather by the
Latin language than the Roman religion, in which it
held no strictly technical meaning, is <i>sanctus</i>, which has
played so large a part in the terminology of the
Catholic Church, and passed thence into the language
of Puritanism for the living Christian, as in Baxter's
famous book, <i>The Saints' Rest</i>. The exact meaning of
<i>sanctus</i> is extremely difficult to fix, and this may be
why it was found to be a convenient word for a type
of character negative rather than positive. The lawyers
defined it as meaning what is <i>sancitum</i> by the State,<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">979</a>
without tracing it back to a time when the State was a
religious as well as a civil entity. But there was beyond
doubt a religious flavour in it from the beginning, as in
other old Italian words connected with it; and thus it
seems to be able to express a certain conjunction of
religious and moral purity which finally brought it into
the hands of the Christian writers. A single verse of
Virgil will serve to explain what I mean. Turnus,
before he rushes forth to meet his death at Aeneas'
hand, and knowing that he is to meet it, asks the
Manes to be good to him, "quoniam superis aversa
voluntas," for&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span><i>sancta</i> ad vos <i>anima</i> atque istius nescia culpae</span>
<span class="i0">descendam magnorum haud unquam indignus avorum.<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">980</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>He goes to the shades with a conscience clear of guilt
or of <i>impietas</i>; as the ancient scholiast interprets the
word, it is equivalent to <i>incorrupta</i>.<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">981</a> In this sense it
became one of the favourite superlatives to describe in
sepulchral inscriptions, pagan or Christian, the purity of
departed women and children.<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">982</a></p>

<p>Lastly, we have the great word <i>sacer</i>, with its compounds
<i>sacrificium</i> and <i>sacramentum</i>. The adjective
itself has no new or special significance, I think, in the
language of the early Christians, and in our Teutonic
languages the Roman sense of it, "that which is made
over to God," is expressed by the word <i>holy</i>, <i>sacred</i>
being retained in a general sense for that which is not
"common." But <i>sacrificium</i>, the act of making a thing,
animate or inanimate, or yourself, as in <i>devotio</i>, over to
the gods, is indeed a great legacy on which I do not
need to dwell. <i>Sacramentum</i>, on the other hand, needs
a word of explanation.</p>

<p><i>Sacramentum</i> in Roman public law meant (1) a legal
formula (<i>legis actio</i>), under which a sum of money was
deposited, originally in a temple,<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">983</a> to be forfeited by
the loser in a suit. The deposition <i>in loco sacro</i> gives
the word to the process, and helps us to see that it
must mean some act which has a religious sanction.
So with (2) its other meaning, <i>i.e</i>. the oath of obedience
taken by the soldier, who was <i>iuratus in verba</i>, that is,
sworn under a formula with a religious sanction attached.<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">984</a>
It is tempting to suppose that it is through this channel
that it found its way into the Christian vocabulary&mdash;the
soldier of Christ affirming his allegiance in the solemn
rites of baptism, marriage, or the Eucharist. It is a
curious fact that it seems to be used in this way in the
religion of Mithras,<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">985</a> which was especially powerful among
the Roman legions of the Empire, and in which there
was a grade of the faithful with the title of <i>milites</i>.
<i>Sacramentum</i> was here the word for the initiatory rites
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>of a grade. In the earliest Christian writers of Latin
it usually means a mystery; thus Arnobius writes of the
Christian religion as revealing the "veritatis absconditae
sacramenta";<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">986</a> but in another passage the idea in his
mind seems to be that of military service. It is better,
he says, for Christians to break their worldly contracts,
even of marriage, than to break the <i>fides Christiana</i>, "<i>et
salutaris militiae sacramenta deponere</i>;"<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">987</a> and Tertullian
more than once attaches the same military meaning to
it: "Vocati sumus ad militiam Dei vivi iam tunc <i>cum
in verba sacramenti spopondimus</i>."<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">988</a> Perhaps we may
take it that the word, though of general significance for
a religiously binding force produced by certain mysterious
rites, had a special attraction for writers of the painful
third century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, as reflecting into the Christian life
from old Roman times something of the spirit of the
duty and self-sacrifice of the loyal legionary. In any
case we have once more a verbal legacy of priceless
value.<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">989</a></p>

<p>To sum up what I have been saying, there were certain
ingredients in the Roman soil, deposits of the Roman
religious experience, which were in their several ways
favourable to the growth of a new plant. There were
also certain direct legacies from the old Roman religion,
of which Christianity could dispose with profit, in the
shape of forms of ritual, and, what was even of greater
value, words of real significance in the old religion, which
were destined to become of permanent and priceless value
in the Christian speech of the western nations. There
were also other points in the society and organisation of
the Roman Empire which were of great importance for
the growth of the new creed; but these lie outside my
proper subject, and have been dealt with by Professor
Gardner in the lecture to which I alluded at the beginning
of this lecture, and most instructively by Sir W. M.
Ramsay in more than one of his books, and especially
in <i>St. Paul, the Traveller and Roman Citizen</i>.</p>

<p>And yet, all this taken together, so far from explaining
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>Christianity, does not help us much in getting to understand
even the conditions under which it grew into men's
minds as a new power in the life of the world. The
plant, though grown in soil which had borne other crops,
was wholly new in structure and vital principle. I say
this deliberately, after spending so many years on the
study of the religion of the Romans, and making myself
acquainted in some measure with the religions of other
peoples. The essential difference, as it appears to me
as a student of the history of religion, is this, that
whereas the connection between religion and morality
has so far been a loose one,&mdash;at Rome, indeed, so loose,
that many have refused to believe in its existence,&mdash;the
<i>new religion was itself morality</i>,<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">990</a> but morality consecrated
and raised to a higher power than it had ever yet reached.
It becomes active instead of passive; mere good nature
is replaced by a doctrine of universal love; <i>pietas</i>, the
sense of duty in outward things, becomes an enthusiasm
embracing all humanity, consecrated by such an appeal
to the conscience as there never had been in the world
before&mdash;the appeal to the life and death of the divine
Master.</p>

<p>This is what is meant, if I am not mistaken, by the
great contrast so often and so vividly drawn by St. Paul
between the spirit and the flesh, between the children of
light and the children of darkness, between the sleep or
the death of the world and the waking to life in Christ,
between the blameless and the harmless sons of God
and the crooked and perverse generation among whom
they shine as lights in the world. I confess that I never
realised this contrast fully or intelligently until I read
through the Pauline Epistles from beginning to end with
a special historical object in view. It is useful to be
familiar with the life and literature of the two preceding
centuries, if only to be able the better to realise, in
passing to St. Paul, a Roman citizen, a man of education
and experience, the great gulf fixed between the old and
the new as he himself saw it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>But historical knowledge, knowledge of the Roman
society of the day, study of the Roman religious
experience, cannot do more than give us a little help;
they cannot reveal the secret. History can explain the
progress of morality, but it cannot explain its consecration.
With St. Paul the contrast is not merely one of
good and bad, but of the spirit and the flesh, of life and
death. No mere contemplation of the world around him
could have kindled the fervency of spirit with which this
contrast is by him conceived and expressed. Absolute
devotion to the life and death of the Master, apart even
from His work and teaching (of which, indeed, St. Paul
says little), this alone can explain it. The love of Christ
is the entirely new power that has come into the world;<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">991</a>
not merely as a new type of morality, but as "<i>a Divine
influence transfiguring human nature in a universal love</i>."
The passion of St. Paul's appeal lies in the consecration
of every detail of it by reference to the life and death
of his Master; and the great contrast is for him not as
with the Stoics, between the universal law of Nature and
those who rebel against it; not as with Lucretius, between
the blind victims of <i>religio</i> and the indefatigable student
of the <i>rerum natura</i>; not, as in the <i>Aeneid</i>, between the
man who bows to the decrees of fate, destiny, God, or
whatever we choose to call it, and the wilful rebel, victim
of his own passions; not, as in the Roman State and
family, between the man who performs religious duties
and the man who wilfully neglects them&mdash;between <i>pius</i>
and <i>impius</i>; but between the universal law of love,
focussed and concentrated in the love of Christ, and the
sleep, the darkness, the death of a world that will not
recognise it.</p>

<p>I will conclude these lectures with one practical
illustration of this great contrast, which will carry us
back for a moment to the ritual of the old Roman <i>ius
divinum</i>. That ritual, we saw, consisted mainly of
sacrifice and prayer, the two apparently inseparable from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>each other. I pointed out that though the efficacy of
the whole process was believed to depend on the strictest
adherence to prescribed forms, whether of actions or
words, the prayers, when we first meet with them, have
got beyond the region of charm or spell, and are cast
in the language of petition; they show clearly a sense
of the dependence of man on the Power manifesting
itself in the universe. There was here, perhaps, a germ
of religious development; but it was arrested in its
growth by the formalisation of the whole Roman religious
system, and no substitute was to be found for it either
in the imported Greek ritual, or in the more enlightening
doctrines of exotic Greek philosophy. The prayers used
in the ritual of Augustus' great festival, which was almost
as much Greek as Roman in character, seem to us as
hard and formal as the most ancient Roman prayers
that have come down to us. In the most emotional
moments of the life of a Roman of enlightenment like
Cicero, when we can truly say of him that he was
touched by true religious feeling, as well as by the
spiritual aspirations of the nobler Greek philosophers,
prayers find no place at all.</p>

<p>But for St. Paul and the members of the early
Christian brotherhood the whole of life was a continuous
worship, and the one great feature of that worship was
prayer. It has been said by a great Christian writer of
recent times that "when the attention of a thinking heathen
was directed to the new religion spreading in the Roman
Empire, the first thing to strike him as extraordinary
would be that a religion of prayer was superseding the
religion of ceremonies and invocation of gods; that it
encouraged all, even the most uneducated, to pray, or, in
other words, to meditate and exercise the mind in self-scrutiny
and contemplation of God."<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">992</a> And, as the
same writer says, prayer thus became a motive power of
moral renewal and <i>inward civilisation</i>, to which nothing
else could be compared for efficacy. And more than
this, it was the chief inward and spiritual means of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>maintaining that universal law of love, which, so far as
this life was concerned, was the great secret of the new
religion.</p>

of the last (the vocabulary), were only taken up by the Church

were growing meaningless; then "the assimilation of Christianity to

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_982_982" id="Footnote_982_982"></a><a href="#FNanchor_982_982"><span class="label">982</span></a> The original meaning of <i>sanctus</i> as applied to things, <i>e.g.</i>
walls and tombs, was probably "inviolable"; Nettleship, <i>Contributions
to Latin Lexicography</i>, <i>s.v.</i> "sanctus," who also suggests a
connection between the word and the attitude of the Roman towards
his dead: thus Cicero in <i>Topica 90</i> writes of <i>aequitas</i> as consisting of
three parts,&mdash;<i>pietas</i>, <i>sanctitas</i>, and <i>iustitia</i>,&mdash;meaning man's relation
to the gods, the Manes, and his fellow-men. Nettleship also quotes
<i>Aen.</i> v. 80 (<i>salve sancte parens</i>), Tibull. ii. 2. 6, and other passages,
which show that the word was specially used of the dead and their
belongings. But when used of persons living, as frequently in the
last century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, it expresses a certain purity of life, not without a
religious tincture, which could not so well be expressed by any other
word, owing to the original meaning being that of religious inviolability.
Thus Cicero uses it in the 9th Philippic of his old friend
Sulpicius, one of the best and purest men of his time; and long
before Cicero, Cato had used it of an obligation at once ethical and
religious: "Maiores <i>sanctius</i> habuere defendi pupillos quam clientem
non fallere." It is interesting to notice that it was used later on of
Mithras and other oriental deities (Cumont, <i>Mon. myst. Mithra</i>, i.
p. 533; <i>Les Religions orientales</i>, p. 289, note 45); in the case of
Mithras, at least, this meant that his life was pure, and that he wished
his worshippers to be pure also.</p></div>

the Christian vocabulary. Apparently it had its chance; for Tertullian
uses it in several ways, <i>e.g.</i>, "summus sacerdos" for a bishop
(<i>de Bapt.</i> 17; "disciplina sacerdotalis," <i>de Monog.</i> 7. 12; and for
other examples see Harnack, <i>Entstehung und Entwickelung der
Kirchenverfassung und des Kirchenrechts in den zwei ersten Jahrhunderten</i>,
1910, p. 85). But the words finally adopted for the
grades of the priesthood were Greek: bishop, priest, and deacon.
Nevertheless, the general word for the priesthood, as distinguished
from the laity, is Latin (<i>ordo</i>); hence "ordination" and holy
"orders." It is not of religious origin, but taken from the language
of municipal life, <i>ordo et plebs</i> being contrasted just as they were
contrasted in <i>municipia</i> as senate (<i>decuriones</i>) and all non-official
persons. See Harnack, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 82.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_990_990" id="Footnote_990_990"></a><a href="#FNanchor_990_990"><span class="label">990</span></a> This is, of course, in one light, the legitimate development of
the union of religion and morality in the Hebrew mind. "For the
Israelite morality, righteousness, is simply doing the will of God,
which from the earliest age is assumed to be ascertainable, and indeed
ascertained. The Law in its simplest form was at once the rule of
morality and the revealed will of God." "The central feature of
O.T. morality is its religious character" (Alexander, <i>Ethics of St.
Paul</i>, p. 34). In the religious system we have been occupied with,
religion can only be reckoned as one of the factors in the growth of
morality; it supplied the sanction for some acts of righteousness, but
(in historical times at least) by no means for all.
</p><p>
Prof. Gwatkin, in his <i>Early Church History</i>, vol. i. p. 54, states
the relation of early Christianity to morality thus: "Christ's person,
not His teaching, is the message of the Gospel. If we know anything
for certain about Jesus of Nazareth, it is that He steadily
claimed to be the Son of God, the Redeemer of mankind, and the
ruler of the world to come, and by that claim the Gospel stands or
falls. Therefore, the Lord's disciples went not forth as preachers of
morality, but as witnesses of his life, and of the historic resurrection
which proved his mightiest claims. Their morality is always an
inference from these, never the forefront of their teaching. They
seem to think that if they can only fill men with true thankfulness
for the gift of life in Christ, morality will take care of itself." I
cannot but think that this is expressed too strongly, or baldly; but
it is in the main in keeping with the impression left on my mind by
a study of St. Paul. It must, however, be remembered that the
Pauline spirit is not exactly that of early Christianity in general: see
Gwatkin, vol. i. p. 98. In the <i>Didache</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, there is no trace of
St. Paul's influence (104).</p></div>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>these lectures at Edinburgh (<i>The Ethics of St. Paul</i>, by Archibald
Alexander), I found a very interesting chapter on "The Dynamic of
the New Life," p. 126 foll. The word which for the author best
expresses that dynamic is <i>faith</i>, which is "the spring of all endeavour,
the inspiration of all heroism" (p. 150). "It brings the whole life
into the domain of spiritual freedom, and is the animating and energising
principle of all moral purpose." What exactly is here understood
by faith is explained on p. 151 to the end of the chapter, of
which I may quote the concluding words: "Faith in Christ means
life in Christ. And this complete yielding of self and vital union
with the Saviour, this dying and rising again, is at once man's
supreme ideal and the source of all moral greatness."</p></div>

<h4>APPENDIX I</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">On The Use of Huts or Booths in Religious Ritual</span></h5>


<p>This may be taken as an addendum to Lecture II. on taboo at
Rome; but owing to the uncertainty of the explanation given in
it, I reserved it for an Appendix. The custom here dealt with
is found both in the public and private worship of the Romans,
and also in Greece and elsewhere, but has never, so far as I
know, been investigated by anthropologists.</p>

<p>On the Ides of March, at the festival of Anna Perenna, a
deity explained as representing "the ring of the year," whose
cult is not recognised in the ancient religious calendar, the lower
population came out of the city, and lay about all day in the
Campus Martius, near the Tiber. Ovid, fortunately, took the
trouble to describe the scene in the third book of his <i>Fasti</i>, as he
had witnessed it himself. Some of them, he says, lay in the
open, <i>some constructed tents, and some made rude huts of stakes
and branches, stretching their togas over them to make a shelter</i>.</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>

<p>It appears also from Ovid's account that there was much
drunkenness and obscene language; this was, in fact, a <i>festa</i> very
different in character from those of the Numan calendar; and
that there was a magical element in the cult of the deity seems
proved by the mysterious allusion to "virgineus cruor" in
connection with her grove not far from this scene of revelry, in
Martial iv. 64. 17 (cp. Pliny, <i>N.H.</i> xxviii. 78, and Columella
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>x. 558). Tibullus describes something of the same kind at
a rustic festival,<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">994</a> though he does not make it clear what time of
year he is speaking of; a few lines before he had mentioned
the drinking and leaping over the fire at the Parilia, the shepherd's
festival in April, though I cannot feel sure that the
following lines are also meant to refer to it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">tunc operata deo pubes discumbet in herba,</span>
<span class="i1">arboris antiquae qua levis umbra cadit,</span>
<span class="i0">aut e veste sua tendent umbracula sertis</span>
<span class="i1">vincta, coronatus stabit et ipse calix.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here it is too much to suppose that the <i>umbracula</i> were contrived
to make up for the want of shade in a country so covered
with woodland as Italy was then; and the words "<i>sertis vincta</i>"
show that there was some special meaning in the practice. I
think we may guess that in both instances the extemporised huts
had some forgotten religious meaning. Yet another passage of
Tibullus, which also describes a rural festival, alludes to a similar
custom.<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">995</a> I have given reasons in the <i>Classical Review</i> for
thinking that this was a summer festival, accompanied as it was,
like many midsummer rites all over Europe, by bonfires and
revelry, though the usual interpretation ascribes it to the winter.<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">996</a></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">tunc nitidus plenis confisus rusticus agris</span>
<span class="i1">ingeret ardenti grandia ligna foco,</span>
<span class="i0">turbaque vernarum, saturi bona signa coloni,</span>
<span class="i1">ludet et ex virgis exstruet ante casas.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The slaves can here hardly be playing at building houses of
twigs, like the children in Horace's <i>Satire</i>,<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">997</a> unless we are to
suppose that Tibullus is thinking of slave children only, which
is indeed possible; but even if that were so, how are we to
account for the popularity of this curious form of sport?</p>

<p>There was, however, at Rome a public summer festival,
included in the calendar, in which we find this same custom.
At the Neptunalia, on July 23, huts or booths were erected,
made of the foliage of trees. "Umbrae vocantur Neptunalibus
<i>casae frondeae pro tabernaculis</i>," says Festus<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">998</a> (following Verrius
Flaccus), where the last word is one in regular use for military
tents. This is the only thing that is told us about this festival,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>and we may assume that even this would not have come down
to us if it had not been a survival rigidly adhered to, <i>i.e.</i> the
construction of shelters from the foliage of trees, instead of
using tents, which could easily have been procured in the city.
As the festival was in the hot month of July, we might suppose
that shelter from the sun was the real object here; but we do
not hear of it at other summer festivals, and the parallel practices
I shall now mention make the rationalising explanation very
doubtful. It is unlucky that we know hardly anything about
the older and un-Graecised Neptunus, and nothing about his
festival except this one fact; the comparative method is here
our only hope.</p>

<p>The Jewish feast of tabernacles will, of course, occur at once
to every one; this was in the heat of the summer, and the booths
were here, as at the Neptunalia, made of the branches of trees;<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">999</a>
the explanation given to the Israelites was not that they were
thus to shelter themselves from the heat, but to be reminded of
their homeless wanderings in the wilderness, plainly an aetiological
account, as in the case of the passover. There are distinct
examples in Greece of the same practice, <i>e.g.</i> the &#963;&#954;&#953;&#7937;&#948;&#949;&#987; at the
Spartan Carneia,<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">1000</a> and tents (&#963;&#954;&#951;&#957;&#945;&#7985;) in several cases, as at the
mysteries of Andania, where the peculiar regulations for the
construction of the tents points to a ritualistic origin almost
unmistakably.<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">1001</a> But perhaps the most striking parallel is to be
found in the famous letter of Gregory the Great, preserved by
Bede, about the British converts to Christianity, who were to be
allowed to use their heathen temples as churches:</p>

<p>"Et quia boves solent in sacrificio daemonum multos occidere,
debet iis etiam hac in re aliqua solemnitas immutari: ut die
dedicationis, vel natalicii sanctorum martyrum quorum illic
reliquiae ponuntur, <i>tabernacula sibi circa easdem ecclesias quae ex
fanis commutatae sunt, de ramis arborum faciant</i>, et religiosis conviviis
sollemnitatem celebrent: nec diabolo iam animalia immolent,
et ad laudem Dei in esu suo animalia occident," etc.<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">1002</a></p>

<p>Why should Gregory here take the trouble to describe the
material out of which these huts were to be made? Surely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>because the custom was one which had been described to him
by Augustine or Mellitus as part of the heathen practice, and
one which he was willing to condone as harmless (possibly with a
recollection of the Jewish feast), since the Britons set great store
by it.</p>

<p>If these examples from Europe and Palestine are sufficient to
suggest that there was originally a religious or mystic meaning in
the custom, we must look for its explanation in anthropological
research. Robertson Smith was,<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">1003</a> I think, the first to suggest a
possible explanation of the Feast of Tabernacles, by comparing
with it the rule, stated in Numbers xxxi. 19, that men might not
enter their houses after bloodshed: "Do ye abide without the
camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever
hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your
captives on the third day and on the seventh day." He also
pointed out that pilgrims are subject to the same rule, or taboo,
in Syria and elsewhere. Since then an immense mass of
evidence has been collected showing that all the world over
persons in a holy or unclean state are placed under this or some
similar restriction;<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">1004</a> and if this be the case with pilgrims and
warriors after a battle, it may also have been so with worshippers
at some particular festival, even if we are quite unable to recover
the special character of the worship which produced the
restriction.<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">1005</a> In the Feast of Tabernacles, which was a harvest
festival, the cause seems to have been the great sanctity of the
first-fruits, which are regarded with extreme veneration in many
parts of the world. In the now famous festival of the first-fruits
among the Natchez Indians of Louisiana, of which the details
have been recorded with singular care and obvious accuracy,<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">1006</a> we
find that the chief, the Great Sun, and all the celebrators, have
to live in huts two miles from their village, while the corn, grown
for the purpose in a particular spot, is sacramentally eaten. It
is quite impossible, without further evidence, which is not likely
ever to be forthcoming, to explain either the Greek, Roman, or
British customs in this way; we must be content with the
general principle that the holiness of human beings at particular
times is liable to carry with it the practice of renouncing your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>own dwelling and living in an extemporised hut or booth. The
tents that we hear of in the Greek rites I look upon as late
developments of this primitive practice. The inscription of
Andania, which is the best Greek evidence we possess, dates
only from 91 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>; and by that time there would have been
every opportunity for the rude huts to become civilised tents.
The <i>casae</i> made by the <i>vernae</i> in Tibullus' poem were, I would
suggest, a kind of unconscious survival of the same feeling and
practice, the real religious meaning being almost entirely lost.</p>

<p>Lastly, I will venture to suggest that the <i>casae</i> of the Roman
custom, made of branches at the Neptunalia and the feast of
Anna Perenna, and of <i>virgae</i> by the slaves on the farm, are
a reminiscence of the earliest form of Italian dwelling, which
survived to historical times in the round temple of Vesta, and of
which we have examples in the hut-urns discovered in the
necropolis at Alba.<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">1007</a> The earliest form of all was probably
a round structure made of branches of trees stuck into the
ground, bent inwards at the top and tied together.<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">1008</a> Just as
bronze instruments survived from an earlier stage of culture in
some religious rites at Rome, so, I imagine, did this ancient
form of dwelling, which really belongs to an age previous to
that of permanent settlement and agricultural routine. The hut
circles of the neolithic age, such as are abundant on Dartmoor,
were probably roofed with branches supported by a central
pole.<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">1009</a></p>

<h4>APPENDIX II</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Prof. Deubner's Theory of the Lupercalia</span></h5>

<h5>(See pp. <a href="#Page_34">34</a> and <a href="#Page_106">106</a>)</h5>


<p>In the <i>Archiv f&uuml;r Religionswissenschaft</i>, 1910, p. 481 foll., Prof.
Deubner has published an interesting study of this puzzling
festival, to which I wish to invite attention, though it has reached
me too late for use in my earlier lectures.</p>

<p>It has long been clear to me that any attempt to explain the
details of the Lupercalia on a single hypothesis must be a failure.
If all the details belong to the same age and the same original
festival, we cannot recover the key to the whole ceremonial,
though we may succeed in interpreting certain features of it with
some success. Is it, however, possible that these details belong
to <i>different</i> periods,&mdash;that the whole rite, as we know it, with all
the details put together from different sources of knowledge, was
the result of an accretion of various features upon an original
simple basis of ceremonial? Prof. Deubner answers this question
in the affirmative, and works out his answer with much skill and
learning.</p>

<p>He begins by explaining the word <i>lupercus</i> as derived from
<i>lupus</i> and <i>arceo</i>, and meaning a "keeper off of wolves." The
<i>luperci</i> were originally men chosen from two gentes or families
to keep the wolves from the sheepfolds, in the days when the
Palatine was a shepherd's settlement, and they did it by running
round the base of the hill in a magical circle (if I understand
him rightly). If that be so, we need not assume a deity Lupercus,
nor in fact any deity at all, nor need we see in the runners a
quasi-dramatic representation of wolves as vegetation-spirits, as
Mannhardt proposed (see my <i>Roman Festivals</i>, p. 316 foll.).
This view has the advantage of making the rite a simple and
practical one, such as would be natural to primitive Latins; and
the etymology is apparently unexceptionable, though it will
doubtless be criticised, as in fact it has been long ago.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>But in course of time, Prof. Deubner goes on, there came to
be engrafted on this simple rite of circumambulation without
reference to a deity, a festival of the rustic god Faunus; and
now there was added a sacrifice of goats, which seem to have
been his favourite victims (kids in Hor. <i>Odes</i>, iii. 18). The
<i>luperci</i>, who had formerly run round the hill quite naked, as in
many rites of the kind (see p. 491), now girt themselves with the
skins of the goats, in order to increase their "religious force"
in keeping away the wolves, with strength derived from the
victims.</p>

<p>But the <i>luperci</i> also carried in their hands, in the festival as
we know it, strips of the skins of the victims, with which they
struck at women who offered themselves to the blows, in order
to make them fertile. This, Prof. Deubner thinks, was a still
later accretion. Life in a city had obliterated the original
meaning of the rite&mdash;the keeping off wolves; but a new meaning
becomes attached to it, presumably growing out of the use of
the skins as magical instruments of additional force. Here, too,
Juno first appears on the scene as the deity of women, for the
strips were known as <i>amicula Iunonis</i> (<i>R.F.</i> 321 and note).
The strips may have been substituted for something carried in
the hand to drive away the wolves; the goat, it should be noted,
is prominent in the cult of Juno, <i>e.g.</i> at Lanuvium. The mystical
meaning of striking or flogging has been sufficiently explained
in this instance by Mannhardt (<i>R.F.</i> p. 320), and is now
familiar to anthropologists in other contexts.</p>

<p>In the period when the fertilisation of women became the
leading feature of the rite, the State took up the popular festival,
and it gained admittance to the religious calendar, which was
drawn up for the city of the four regions (see above, Lect. IV.,
p. 106). The State was represented, as we learn from Ovid,
by the Flamen Dialis (<i>Fasti</i>, ii. 282).</p>

<p>But we still have to account for some strange detail, which
has never been satisfactorily explained in connection with the rest
of the ceremony. The runners had their foreheads smeared
with the blood of the victims, which was then wiped off with
wool dipped in milk; after which, says Plutarch (<i>Romulus</i>, 21),
they were obliged to laugh. These details, as Prof. Deubner
remarks, seem very un-Roman; we have no parallel to them in
Roman ritual, and I have remarked more than once in these
lectures on the absence of the use of blood in Roman ceremonial.
I have suggested that they were allowed to survive in
the religion of the city-state, though actually belonging to that
of a primitive population living on the site of Rome. Prof.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>Deubner's explanation is very different, and at first sight
startling. These, he thinks, are Greek cathartic details added
by Augustus when he re-organised the Lupercalia, as we may
guess that he did from Suet. <i>Aug.</i> 31. They can all be
paralleled from Greek religion. We know of them only from
Plutarch, who quotes a certain Butas as writing Greek elegiacs in
which they were mentioned; but of the date of this poet we
know nothing. Ovid does not mention these details, nor hint
at them in the stories he tells about the festival. (It is certainly
possible that Augustus's revision may have been made after
Ovid wrote the second book of the <i>Fasti</i>; it could not have
been done until he became Pont. Max. in 12 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and perhaps
not till long after that, and the <i>Fasti</i> was written some time
before Ovid's banishment in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 9.) That Augustus should insert
Greek cathartic details in the old Roman festival is certainly
surprising, but not impossible. We know that in the <i>ludi
saeculares</i> he took great pains to combine Greek with Roman
ritual.</p>

<p>The above is a mere outline of Prof. Deubner's article, but
enough, I hope, to attract the attention of English scholars to it.
Whether or no it be accepted in whole or part by learned
opinion, it will at least have the credit of suggesting a way
in which not only the Lupercalia, but possibly other obscure
rites, may be compelled ultimately to yield up their secrets.</p>

<h4>APPENDIX III</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Pairs of Deities In Gellius</span> xiii. 23 (see page 150)</h5>


<p>The first paired deity mentioned by Gellius is <i>Lua Saturni</i>,
also known as <i>Lua Mater</i>, of whom Dr. Frazer writes (p. 412),
"In regard to Lua we know that she was spoken of as a
mother, which makes it not improbable that she was also
a wife." We are not surprised to find him claiming that
because Vesta is addressed as Mater in the <i>Acta Fratr.
Arv.</i> (Henzen, p. 147), that virgin deity was also married. This
he does in his lectures on Kingship (p. 222), quoting Ennius
and Lactantius as making Vesta mother of Saturnus and Titan.
No comment on this is needed for any one conversant with
Graeco-Roman religion and literature from Ennius onward.
The title Mater here means simply that Vesta was to her
worshippers in a maternal position: "quamvis virginem, indole
tamen quadam materna praeditam fuisse nuper exposuit
Preunerus," says Henzen, quoting Preuner's <i>Hestia-Vesta</i>, an
old book but a good one (p. 333). But to return to Lua: I
freely confess that I cannot explain why she was styled Mater.
We only know of her, apart from the list in Gellius and one
passage of Servius, from the two passages of Livy quoted without
comment by Dr. Frazer. The first of these (viii. 1), which may be
taken from the pontifical books, seems to let in a ray of light on
her nature and function. In 338 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> the Volscians had been
beaten, and "armorum magna vis" was found in their camp.
"Ea Luae Matri se dare consul dixit, finesque hostium usque ad
maritimam oram depopulatus est." That is, as I understand the
words, he dedicated the enemy's spoils to the <i>numen</i> who was the
enemy of his own crops.<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">1010</a> For if Lua be connected etymologically
with <i>lues</i>, she may be the hurtful aspect of Saturnus, like <i>Tursa</i>
Cerfia Cerfii Martii as Buecheler explains it (<i>Umbrica</i>, p. 98).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>A curious passage of Servius may be quoted in support of this
view, in which Luae is an almost certain correction for Lunae
(see Jordan's edition of Preller's <i>Rom. Mythol.</i> vol. ii. p. 22).
Commenting on Virgil's "Arboribusque satisque lues" (<i>Aen.</i> iii.
139), he writes: "quidam dicunt, diversis numinibus vel bene
vel male faciendi potestatem dicatam, ut Veneri coniugia, Cereri
divortia, Iunoni procreationem liberorum: sterilitatem horum
tam Saturno quam Luae, hanc enim sicut Saturnum orbandi
potestatem habere." Whatever Lua may originally have been,
she seems to have been regarded as a power capable of working
for evil in the crops and in women; if you could get her to
work on your enemy's crops (cp. the <i>excantatio</i>, above p. 58), so
much the better, and the better would her claim be to the title
of Mater (but Dr. Frazer supplies us with examples of a <i>hostile</i>
spirit being called by a family name, <i>e.g.</i>, Grandfather Smallpox,
<i>G.B.</i> iii. p. 98). When the consul had dedicated the spoils to
her he proceeded to assist her in her functions by ravaging the
crops of the enemy; thus she became later on a deity of spoils.
In the Macedonian triumph of <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 167 we find her in company
with Mars and Minerva as one of the deities to whom "spolia
hostium dicare ius fasque est" (Livy xlv. 33).</p>

<p>I may add here that Dr. Frazer has another arrow in his
quiver to prove that Saturnus was married: if Lua was not his
wife (which no Roman asserts) certainly (he says) Ops was. He
quotes a few words from Macrobius (i. 13. 19) in which these
two are mentioned as husband and wife. If he had quoted the
whole passage, his reader would have been better able to judge
of the value of the writers of whom Macrobius says that they
"crediderunt" that Ops was wife of Saturn. For it appears
that some of them fancied that Saturnus was "a satu dictus
<i>cuius causa de caelo est</i>"&mdash;(a desperate attempt to make the old
spirit of the seed into a heaven-god), while Ops, whose name
speaks for itself, was the earth. But the real companion deity
to Ops was not Saturnus, but Consus. This has been placed
beyond all reasonable doubt by Wissowa in his <i>de Feriis</i>
(reprinted in <i>Gesammelte Abhandlungen</i>, p. 154 foll.). See also
my <i>R.F.</i> p. 212. The names Ops and Consus obviously refer
to stored corn, and everything in their cult points the same way.
Saturnus' connection with Ops is a late and a mistaken one,
derived from the Graecising tendency, which brought Cronos
and Rhea to bear on them.</p>

<p>Next a word about Hora Quirini. As this coupling of names
is followed by Virites Quirini, in the characteristic method
explained in the text (cp. Cic. <i>Nat. Deor.</i> ii. 27 of Vesta, "<i>vis</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>eius ad aras et focos pertinet"), it is hardly necessary to comment
on it. Hora is perhaps connected with Umbrian Heris (cp.
Buecheler, <i>Umbrica</i>, index), which with kindred forms means
will, willingness. Thus in "Nerienem Mavortis et Herem"
(Ennius, fragm. 70, in Baehrens, <i>Fragm. Poet. Lat.</i>) we may
see the strength and the will of Mars (cp. Herie Iunonis).
Hora is also connected in legend with Hersilia (Ov. <i>Met.</i> 14.
829), and this helps to show how the Alexandrian erotic legend-making
faculty got hold of her. But, says Dr. Frazer, Ennius
regarded her as wife of Quirinus: "Teque Quirine pater veneror,
Horamque Quirini" (fragm. 71 of the <i>Annales</i>). This is Dr.
Frazer's interpretation of the words, but Ennius says nothing
of conjugal relations; and even if he had, his evidence as to
ancient Roman conceptions would be worthless. Ennius was
not a Roman; he came from Magna Graecia; and if Dr. Frazer
will read <i>all</i> that is said about him, <i>e.g.</i> in Schanz's history of
Roman literature, he will allow that every statement of such
a man about old Roman ideas of the divine must be regarded
with suspicion and subjected to careful criticism.</p>

<p>Next we come to Salacia Neptuni. Of this couple Dr. Frazer
says that Varro plainly implies that they were husband and wife,
and that this is affirmed by Augustine, Seneca, and Servius.
The accumulation of evidence seems strong; but Varro implies
nothing of the kind (<i>L.L.</i> v. 72). He is indulging in fancy
etymologies, and derives Neptunus from <i>nubere</i>, "quod mare
terras obnubit ut nubes caelum, ab nuptu id est opertione ut
antiqui, a quo nuptiae, nuptus dictus." If he had meant to
make Salacia wife of Neptunus, this last sentence would surely
have suggested it; but he goes on after a full stop, "Salacia
Neptuni a salo." It is only the later writers, ignorant of the
real nature of Roman religious ideas, who make Salacia into a
wife. It is worth noting that Varro adds another feminine deity
in his next sentence, Venilia, whom Virgil makes the mother
of Turnus (<i>Aen.</i> x. 76); and Servius, commenting on this line,
goes one better, and says she was identical with Salacia. Perhaps
both were sea or water spirits, connected with Neptunus as
<i>famulae</i> or <i>anculae</i> (see Wissowa, <i>R.K.</i> p. 19), but they are lost
to us, and speculation is useless. In <i>R.F.</i> p. 186, I suggested
an explanation of Salacia which I am disposed to withdraw.
But for anyone wishing to study the treatment of old Roman
<i>numina</i> by the mythologists and philosophers of the Graeco-Roman
period, I would recommend an attentive reading of the
whole chapter of Augustine from which Dr. Frazer quotes a few
words (<i>C.D.</i> vii. 22); and further a careful study of the Graeco-Roman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>methods of fabricating myths about Roman divine names,
for which he will do well to read the passages referred to by
Wissowa in <i>R.K.</i> pp. 250 and 251, and notes.</p>

<p>Lastly, comes Maia Volcani. Here for once we get a fact of
cult, which is a relief, after the loose and reckless statements of
non-Roman and Christian writers. The flamen Volcanalis
sacrificed to Maia on May 1st, which proves that there was a
real and not a fancied connection between Volcanus and Maia,
but certainly not that they were husband and wife. Dr. Frazer,
however, quotes Cincius "on the <i>Fasti</i>" as (ap. Macrob. i. 12. 18)
stating this, and refers us to Schanz's <i>Gesch. der r&ouml;m. Lit.</i> for
information about him. In the second edition of that work he
will find a discussion of the very doubtful question as to whether
the Cincius he quotes is the person whom he asserts him to be,
viz., the annalist of the second Punic War. The writer of the
article "Cincius" in Pauly-Wissowa <i>Real-Encycl.</i> is very confident
that the one who wrote on the <i>Fasti</i> lived as late as the age of
Augustus. But putting that aside, what are we to make of the
fact that another annalist, L. Calpurnius Piso (famous as the
author of the first lex de repetundis, 149 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), said that the wife
of Volcanus was not Maia, but Maiestas? Piso was not a good
authority (see above, p. 51), but he seems here to bring the
"consort" of the fire-god into line with such expressions of activity
as Moles, Virites, and so on; and it seems that as early as the
second century b.c., sport and speculation with these names were
beginning. I have quoted the whole pedantic passage from
Macrobius in my <i>Roman Festivals</i>, p. 98, where the reader may
enjoy it at leisure. I shall not be surprised if he comes to the
conclusion that neither Macrobius nor his learned informers
knew anything about Maia. When he reads that she was the
mother of Mercurius, he will recollect that Mercurius was not a
Roman deity of the earliest period, and did not belong to the
<i>di indigetes</i>; and when he finds that she is identified with
Bona Dea, he must not forget that that deity, as scholars are now
pretty well agreed, was introduced at Rome from Tarentum in
the age of the Punic Wars. The one fact we know is the
sacrifice by the flamen Volcanalis on May 1. Someone went to
work to explain this and another, viz. that the Ides of the month
was the dedication day of the first temple of Mercurius (<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 495),
and also the fact that the temple of the Bona Dea on the
Aventine was dedicated on the Kalends. The result was an
extraordinary jumble of fancy and myth, which has been
recognised as such by those who have studied closely the
methods of Graeco-Roman scholarship. The unwary, of course,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>are taken in. A student of these methods might do well to take
as an exercise in criticism the three "specimens of Roman
mythology" which Dr. Frazer says (p. 413) have "survived the
wreck of antiquity"&mdash;the loves of Vertumnus and Pomona, of
Jupiter and Juturna, of Janus and Cardea. In the last of these
especially he will find one of the most audacious pieces of
charming and wilful invention that a Latin poet could perpetrate,
in imitation of Hellenistic love tales, and to suit the
taste of a public whose education was mainly Greek.</p>

<p>The above lengthy note was written before I had seen
von Domaszewski's paper on this subject ("Festschrift f&uuml;r O.
Hirschfeld") reprinted in <i>Abhandlungen zur r&ouml;m. Religion</i>, p. 104
foll. cp. p. 162.) His explanations are different in detail from
mine, but rest on the same general principle that the names
Salacia, etc., indicate functions or attributes of the male deity
to whom they are attached.</p>

<h4>APPENDIX IV</h4>

<h5>(<span class="smcap">Lecture</span> VIII., page 169 foll.) <span class="smcap">Ius and Fas</span></h5>


<p>In historical times the two kinds of <i>ius</i>, <i>divinum</i> and <i>humanum</i>,
were strongly distinguished (see Wissowa, <i>R.K.</i> p. 318, who
quotes Gaius ii. 2: "summa itaque rerum divisio in duos articulos
diducitur, nam aliae sunt divini iuris, aliae humani"). But it
is almost certain that there was originally no such clear distinction.
The general opinion of historians of Roman law is thus
expressed by Cuq (<i>Institutions juridiques des Romains</i>, p. 54):
"Le droit civil n'a eu d'abord qu'une port&eacute;e fort restreinte. Peu
&agrave; peu il a gagn&eacute; du terrain, il a entrepris de r&eacute;glementer des
rapports qui autrefois &eacute;taient du domaine de la religion. Pendant
longtemps &agrave; Rome le droit th&eacute;ocratique a coexist&eacute; avec le
droit civil." (See also Muirhead, <i>Introduction to Roman Law</i>, ed.
Goudy, p. 15.) Possibly the formation of an organised calendar,
marking off the days belonging to the deities from those which
were not so made over to them, first gave the opportunity
for the gradual realisation of the thought that the set of rules
under which the citizen was responsible to the divine beings
was not exactly the same as that under which he was responsible
to the civil authorities. The distinction took many ages to
realise in all its aspects, and is not complete even under the
XII. Tables or later, because the sanction for civil offences
remained in great part a divine one; on this point Jhering is
certainly wrong (<i>Geist des r&ouml;m. Rechts</i>, i. 267 foll.). As Cuq
remarks (p. 54, note 1), one institution of the <i>ius divinum</i> kept
its force after the complete secularisation of law, and retains
it to this day, viz. the oath.</p>

<p>If there was originally no distinction between religious and
civil rules of law, it follows that there were originally no two
distinguishing terms for them. The earliest passage in which
they are distinguished as <i>ius divinum</i> and <i>humanum</i> (so far as I
know) is Cicero's speech for Sestius (<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 56), sec. 91, quoted by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>Wissowa, p. 319: "domicilia coniuncta quas urbes dicimus, <i>invento
et divino iure et humano</i>, moenibus cinxerunt." But by all British
writers on Roman law, and by many foreign ones, the word <i>fas</i>
is used as equivalent to the ius divinum, and sharply distinguished
from <i>ius</i>. Thus the late Dr. Greenidge, in his useful
work on Roman public life (p. 52 and elsewhere), makes this
distinction; he writes of the <i>rex</i> as the chief expounder of the
divine law (<i>fas</i>), and of the control exercised by <i>fas</i> over the
citizen's life. Cp. Muirhead, ed. Goudy, p. 15 foll., where
Mommsen is quoted thus: "Mommsen is probably near the
mark when he describes the <i>leges regiae</i> as mostly rules of
the <i>fas</i>." But Mommsen, like Wissowa in his <i>Religion und
Kultus</i>, does not use the word <i>fas</i>, but speaks of "Sakralrecht."
Sohm, on the other hand (<i>Roman Law</i>, trans. Ledlie, p. 15, note),
compares <i>fas</i> with Sanscrit <i>dharma</i> and Greek <i>themis</i>, as meaning
unwritten rules of divine origin, which eventually gave way
before <i>ius</i>, as in Greece before &#948;&#7985;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957;. (Cp. Binder, <i>Die Plebs</i>,
p. 501.) But it is safer in this case to leave etymology alone,
and to try to discover what the Romans themselves understood
by <i>fas</i>, which is indeed a peculiar and puzzling word. (For its
possible connection with <i>fari</i>, <i>effari</i> (ager effatus), <i>fanum</i>, and
<i>profanum</i>, etc., see H. Nettleship's <i>Contributions to Latin Lexicography</i>,
s.v. "Fas.")</p>

<p><i>Fas</i> was at all times indeclinable, and is rarely found even as
an accusative, as in Virg. <i>Aen.</i> ix. 96:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">mortaline manu factae immortale carinae</span>
<span class="i0">fas habeant?</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the oldest examples of its use, <i>i.e.</i> in the ancient calendar
QRCF, on March 24 and May 24, <i>i.e.</i> "quando rex comitiavit fas"
(Varro, <i>L.L.</i> vi. 31), and QStDF on June 15, <i>i.e.</i> "Quando stercus
delatum fas" (Varro, <i>L.L.</i> vi. 32), it is hard to say whether it is
a substantive at all, and not rather an adverb like <i>satis</i>. So, too,
in the antique language of the <i>lex templi</i> of Furfo (58 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>)
we read, "Utii tangere sarcire tegere devehere defigere mandare
ferro oeti promovere referre <i>fasque esto</i>" (<i>liceat</i> should probably
be inserted before <i>fasque esto</i>). See <i>CIL.</i> i. 603, line 7; Dessau,
<i>Inscript. Lat. selectae</i>, ii. 1. 4906, p. 246. In these examples
<i>fas</i> simply means that you may do certain acts without breaking
religious law; it does not stand for the religious law itself. To
me it looks like a technical word of the <i>ius divinum</i>, meaning
that which it is lawful to do under it; thus a <i>dies fastus</i> is one
on which it is lawful under that <i>ius</i> to perform certain acts of
civil government, "sine piaculo" (Varro, <i>L.L.</i> vi. 29). <i>Nefas</i> is,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>therefore, in the same way a word which conveys a prohibition
under the divine law. By constant juxtaposition with <i>ius</i>, <i>fas</i>
came in course of time to take on the character of a substantive,
and so too did its opposite <i>nefas</i>. The dictionaries supply many
examples of its use as a substantive and as paralleled with <i>ius</i>,
but the only one I can find that is earlier than Cicero is Terence,
<i>Hecyra</i>, iii. 3. 27, <i>i.e.</i> in the work of a non-Roman.</p>

<p>I cannot find that it is so used by Varro, where we might
naturally have expected it. Cicero does not call his imaginary
ius divinum a <i>fas</i>, but iura religionum, constitutio religionum
(<i>de Legibus</i> ii. 10-23, 17-32). <i>Ius</i> is the word always used
technically of particular departments of the religious law, <i>e.g.</i>
ius pontificium, ius augurale, and ius fetiale (<i>CIL.</i> i. p. 202, is
preimus ius fetiale paravit). The notion that <i>fas</i> could mean
a kind of code of religious law is probably due to Virgil's use of
the word in "Quippe etiam festis quaeddam exercere diebus
Fas et iura sinunt," <i>Georg.</i> i. 269, and to the comment of
Servius, "id est, divina humanaque iura permittunt: nam ad
religionem fas, ad homines iura pertinent."</p>

<p>It is strange to find it personified as a kind of deity in the
formula of the fetiales, used when they announced the Roman
demands at an enemy's frontier (Livy i. 32): "Audi Iuppiter,
inquit, audite Fines (cuiuscunque gentis sunt nominat), <i>audiat
Fas</i>." Whence did Livy get this formula? We have no record
of a book of the fetiales; if this came from those of the pontifices,
as is probable, the formula need not be of ancient date,
and the personification of Fines also suggests a doubt as to
the genuineness of the whole formula.</p>

<h4>APPENDIX V</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Worship of Sacred Utensils</span> (page <a href="#Page_436">436</a>)</h5>


<p>There can be no doubt that some kind of worship was paid by
the Arval Brethren to certain <i>ollae</i>, or primitive vessels of sun-baked
clay used in their most ancient rites. This is attested by
two inscriptions of different ages which are printed on pp. 26
and 27 of Henzen's <i>Acta Fratrum Arvalium</i>. After leaving their
grove and entering the temple "in mensa <i>sacrum fecerunt ollis</i>";
and shortly afterwards, "in aedem intraverunt et <i>ollas precati
sunt</i>." Then, to our astonishment, we read that the door of the
temple was opened, and the <i>ollae</i> thrown down the slope in front
of it. This last act seems inexplicable; but the worship finds
a singular parallel in the dairy ritual of the Todas of the
Nilghiri hills.</p>

<p>Dr. Rivers, in his work on the Todas (Macmillan, 1906, p.
453), in summing up his impressions of their worship, observes
that "the attitude of worship which is undoubtedly present
in the Toda mind is becoming transferred from the gods
themselves to the material objects used in the service of the
gods." "The religious attitude of worship is being transferred
from the gods themselves <i>to the objects round which centres the
ritual of the dairy</i>." These objects are mainly the bells of the
buffaloes and the dairy vessels; and an explicit account of them,
the reverence in which they are held, and the prayers in which
they are mentioned, will be found in the fifth, sixth, and eighth
chapters of Dr. Rivers' work, which, as an account of what seems
to be a religion atrophied by over-development of ritual, is in
many ways of great interest to the student of Roman religious
experience. The following sentence will appeal to the readers
of these Lectures:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Todas seem to show us how the over-development
of the ritual aspect of religion may lead to atrophy of those ideas
and beliefs through which the religion has been built up; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>then how, in its turn, the ritual may suffer, and acts which are
performed mechanically, with no living ideas behind them, may
come to be performed carelessly and incompletely, while religious
observances which involve trouble and discomfort may be
evaded or completely neglected."</p>

<p>Whether the worship of the <i>ollae</i> was a part of the original
ritual of the Brethren, or grew up after its revival by Augustus, it
is impossible to determine. But if we can allow the dairy ritual
of the Todas to help us in the matter, we may conclude that
in any case it was not really primitive, and that it was a result of
that process of over-ritualisation to which must also be ascribed
the <i>piacula</i> caused by the growth of a fig-tree on the roof of the
temple, and the three Sonderg&ouml;tter Adolenda Commolenda
Deferunda. (See above p. <a href="#Page_161">161</a> foll., and Henzen, <i>Acta Fratr.
Arv.</i> p. 147.)</p>

<i>ATHEN&AElig;UM.</i>&mdash;"A very readable as well as learned monograph on an
attractive subject.... We have found the book excellent reading."<br />

<i>DAILY NEWS.</i>&mdash;"A work of brilliant scholarship and an admirable piece
of writing."</small></p>

<h6>AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF THE

<p><small><i>SPECTATOR.</i>&mdash;"This work is intended as an introduction to the study of
the religion of the Romans, and a very faithful and accurate piece of work it is,
as indeed might be expected by those who know Mr. Fowler's previous studies of
ancient life."<br />

<i>GUARDIAN.</i>&mdash;"A delightful volume which will attract and interest any
educated and thoughtful reader."<br />

<i>ACADEMY.</i>&mdash;"A book with which every student of Roman religion will
have to make his account.... Alike as a storehouse of critically-sifted facts
and as a tentative essay towards the synthetic arrangement of these facts, Mr.
Fowler's book seems to us to mark a very distinct advance upon anything that
has yet been done."</small></p>

a very skilful and scholarly fashion."<br />

<i>CLASSICAL REVIEW.</i>&mdash;"This little book is excellent both in design and
in execution, and it supplies a want which has been much felt by those engaged
in teaching ancient history.... A book which will have a most stimulating effect
on the teaching of ancient history, and which ought to become familiar to every
schoolboy and undergraduate."<br />

<i>WESTMINSTER GAZETTE.</i>&mdash;"It is impossible within any available
limits to give an adequate account of Mr. Fowler's treatment of his subject. We
can but commend his treatise to our readers; and this we can do without reserve."<br />

<i>OXFORD MAGAZINE.</i>&mdash;"One of those charming books which by their
excellence are able to commend themselves to entirely different persons....
The man beginning work for 'Greats' will always be told that he must read this;
and if he do so, will be rewarded by having the relations of the different parts of
his reading marked out with masterly clearness; and the student who has been
over most of the ground himself in original authorities, will find with pleasure
fresh light thrown on many points by Mr. Fowler's grace of style and power of
illustration.... We cordially recommend it as at once charmingly written, and
accurate, useful and stimulating."</small></p>
